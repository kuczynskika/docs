# Relays Overview

![Relays Pn](/docs-main/images/relays.png)

## What are Relays?

Relays are **inbox automations** for MessageDesk. They listen for **events**, check **conditions**, and run **actions**—so the right conversation reaches the right person at the right time.

---

## Why Use Relays?

- **Scale without chaos:** Auto-assign and auto-label to keep your inbox clean as volume grows.
- **Respond faster:** Send **after-hours** or **first-touch** replies automatically.
- **Reduce busywork:** Route by **phone line**, **label**, or **teammate** so people start where they can help most.
- **Stay consistent:** Use the same rules every time—no missed handoffs.

## How Relays Work (at a glance)

![Relay Example Pn](/docs-main/images/relay-example.png)

**Trigger → Conditions → Actions**

- **Trigger:** When should this run? (e.g., when a new message arrives)
- **Conditions:** 
  - Should it run for _this_ conversation? (e.g., line = Support, is anonymous)
  - When is it allowed to run? (e.g., after-hours auto-reply)
- **Actions:** What should happen? (assign teammate, add label, send message)

## What Relays are Great at

- **Out-of-office auto-replies** → Example: “We’ll reply at 9 am.”
- **Capture** **anonymous contacts **→ Example: “What’s your name?” + label “Anonymous.”
- **Route to teammates **→ Example: Messages to a Support line are auto-assigned to a member of the Support team.
- **Route to labels** → Example: Add labels like _Urgent_ or _VIP_ to fast-track triage.

## Starter patterns (copy these ideas to get started)

**After-hours reply**

- Trigger: inbound message
- Condition: outside active hours
- Action: send message (set expectations)

**New conversation on a Support line**

- Trigger: inbound message
- Conditions: is new **AND** line = Support
- Actions: assign teammates (Support), add label (Support)

**Anonymous contact capture**

- Trigger: inbound message
- Condition: conversation is anonymous
- Actions: send message asking name, add label (Anonymous)
