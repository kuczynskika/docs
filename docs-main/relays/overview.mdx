# How to Automate with Relays

Relays are **automations** for MessageDesk. They listen for **events**, evaluate **conditions**, and run **actions**—so the right conversation reaches the right person at the right time.

## Why Use Relays?

- **Scale without chaos:** Auto-assign and auto-label to keep your inbox tidy as volume grows.
- **Respond faster:** Send **after-hours** and **first-touch** replies automatically.
- **Reduce busywork:** Route by **phone line**, **label**, or **teammate** so work starts in the right place.
- **Stay consistent:** Standardize rules so there are no missed handoffs.

## What You Can Do With Relays

1. **Out-of-office auto-reply:** Send an automatic response outside your business hours.
2. **Keyword replies:** Trigger a preset message when a contact texts a specific keyword.
3. **Identify unknown contacts:** Detect anonymous conversations and request name/phone/email automatically.
4. **Auto-assign:** Assign new conversations to one or more teammates as they arrive.
5. **Auto-label:** Apply labels (e.g., _Support_, _HR: New Hire_, _Region: West_) based on line, content, or rules.
6. **Custom Relays:** Combine your own conditions and actions to match your workflow.

<Tip>
  All Relay templates are customizable—you can adjust wording, labels, assignees, active hours, and more.

## How Relays Work (At a Glance)

![Relay Example Pn](/docs-main/images/relay-example.png)

**Relays = Triggers → Conditions → Actions**

- **Triggers:** When it runs\
  _Example:_ `MessageReceived` (a new inbound text starts the relay)
- **Conditions:** Where/when it applies\
  _Examples:_\
  • **Phone line** equals _Support_\
  • **Is anonymous** contact is **true**\
  • **Active hours** = outside business hours
- **Actions:** What happens\
  _Examples:_\
  • **Assign teammates**\
  • **Add labels**\
  • **Send message** (auto-reply with templates/tags)

You can **pause** and **resume** any Relay without deleting it.
