# How to Create & Edit Relays

Build reliable automations with a clear flow: **Trigger → Conditions → Actions**. This guide shows you how to configure, test, and troubleshoot Relays.

## How to Create or Edit a Relay

### **1. Visit the Relays Module**

When you first visit the Relay's module, you can get started by selecting a **template.**

![Relays Templates Pn](/docs-main/images/relays-templates.png)

Templates give you an idea of what's possible with Relays, but you can customize each template to your liking or start from scratch to create your own Relay. Just click Add Relay to get started.

Once you add a Relay, you'll see it listed in the Relays tab. Each Relay has a toggle state for on/off. you can also delete individual Relays from this view as well.

<Note>
  **Note:** By default, all Relays start in the paused state.
</Note>

### 2. Give your Relay a name and description

Click the three dot icon for "more" (next to the toggle) then edit the Relay name and description. You can also delete the Relay. 

<Tip>
  **Tip:** Copy/paste/add emojis to visually distinguish Relays in your list.
</Tip>

### 3. Set a trigger

Currently, MessageDesk only supports the **Message Received** trigger. We plan on adding more trigger types in the near future. For all templates, this trigger will appear as a default and is not currently editable.

### 4. Add or edit conditions

Conditions have two parts: a logical operator (AND/OR) and conditions themselves.

#### Select a logical operator:

- Selecting AND means all conditions must be met for the Relay to run.
- Selecting OR means any condition must be met for the Relay to run.

**Select a condition:**

- **Message contains text** (any specified keyword like SUPPORT or HELP)
- **My phone number equals** (a phone line connected to your MessageDesk workspace)
- **Is anonymous conversation** (a conversation with an anonymous contact)
- **Is new conversation** (any new conversation)
- **Active hours** (times of the day when your Relay is active)

<Tip>
  **Tip**: Select **Trigger outside of business hours** to flip the active hours logic to run \_outside of the specified timeframe \_(this works great for after-hours replies).
</Tip>

### 5. Add actions

Actions are things that happen once conditions are met. Currently, MessageDesk offers three actions, but we plan on adding more in the future:

- **Reply to message** (sends an outbound SMS/MMS message)
- **Assign teammates to the conversation** (assigns one or more teammates to the conversation)
- **Add labels to the conversation** (Applies one or more labels to the conversation)

<Note>
  Note: You can add multiple actions to a Relay, not just one. For example, you can reply to a message, assign a teammate to the conversation, and label the conversation all in one Relay.
</Note>

<Tip>
  **Tip**: Set a **Delay** for the Reply to message action to delay sending your message for a time after the Relay conditions are met. Delays can help you avoid repeated message sends if a Relay message was sent recently.
</Tip>

### 6. Toggle to activate and save your relay

Once you're ready, save and activate your Relay by toggling it on.

## Managing Relays

### Pause and Resume Relays

You can **pause** a Relay at any time to temporarily disable it without deleting your configuration. This is useful when you need to stop an automation temporarily but plan to use it again later.

- **From the Relays list:** Use the pause/resume toggle next to each Relay to quickly enable or disable it.
- **From the Relay details view:** Open any Relay and use the active/paused toggle at the top of the profile to change its status.

When a Relay is paused, it will not trigger or run any actions until you resume it.

### Delete a Relay

To permanently remove a Relay:

1. Open the Relay profile
2. Click the menu (three dots)
3. Select **Delete**

<Warning>
  Deleting a Relay is permanent and cannot be undone. If you might need the Relay again, consider pausing it instead.
</Warning>

## Relay Templates

### Respond to a keyword

Set keywords like SUPPORT to trigger automatic text message responses. You can use any keyword you like to trigger your Relay.

> **Trigger:** Message received
>
> \*\*Conditions: \*\*Message contains text = SUPPORT
>
> **Actions:** Reply to message
>
> T**ext:** "Thanks, this looks like an issue we need to route to support. Are there any other important details we should know here before we start investigating?"

<Tip>
  **Tip:** keep your **keywords** short and memorable
</Tip>

### Identify unknown conversations and contact

Use this Reply to anonymous conversations with a follow-up asking for info.

> **Trigger:** Message received

>
> **Actions:** Reply to message

### Assign new conversations to teammates

Use this Relay to assign new conversations to teammates.

> **Trigger:** Message received

### Automatically label conversation

Label new conversations automatically for better sorting within your Inbox.

> **Trigger:** Message received

Yes

**Can I include media in auto-replies?**\
Yes. Keep each file **≤ 10 MB** (files \> **500 KB** send as links). See [**Media**](/messaging/media) guide.

**Can I pause a Relay without deleting it?**\
Yes. You can pause a Relay from the Relays list using the toggle, or from within the Relay profile. See [Managing Relays](#managing-relays) for details.

## Troubleshooting

**A Relay didn’t fire.**

- Confirm the **Trigger** is correct
- Check to see if your Relay is **Paused**.
- Loosen **Conditions** (try removing an AND condition temporarily).

**Auto-reply sent multiple times.**

- Add a **Delay** to your Relay.

**Actions didn’t run after conditions matched.**

- Check for **permission limits** (roles) on assignees/labels.
- Remove long **Delays** while testing.

## Best practices

- **Name your Relays clearly:** “After-hours reply – Support line” beats “Relay 1”.
- **Start simple:** One trigger, one condition, one action—then iterate.
- **Document the owner:** Note who maintains each Relay in the description.
