# How to Create, Edit & Delete Relays

Build reliable automations with a clear flow: **Trigger → Conditions → Actions**. This guide shows you how to configure, test, and troubleshoot Relays.

---

## How to Create or Edit a Relay

### 1. Visit the Relays module

When you first visit **Relays**, you’ll see **templates** you can use as a starting point, just click **Add Relay** to start building.

![Relays Templates Pn](/docs-main/images/relays-templates.png)

All Relays appear in the **Relays** tab with an **On/Off** toggle. You can delete Relays from the same view.

<Note>
  By default, new Relays are **paused**. Toggle them **On** when you’re ready.
</Note>

### 2. Name and describe your Relay

Click the vertical **⋯** (three dots) next to a Relay to **Rename**, **Edit description**, or **Delete**.

<Tip>
  Add an emoji (e.g., 💤 for after-hours) to make Relays easy to scan.
</Tip>

### 3. Set a **Trigger**

Current supported trigger: **Message Received** (fires when a new inbound SMS arrives).

<Note>
  **Note:** Templates include the **message received** trigger by default.
</Note>

### 4. Add **Conditions**

Conditions control **where/when** a Relay runs. You can combine multiple conditions with **AND** or **OR**.

**Available conditions:**

- **Message contains text** — match keywords like `SUPPORT`, `HELP`
- **My phone number equals** — run only on a specific outbound line
- **Is anonymous conversation** — no saved contact yet
- **Is new conversation** — first inbound in a thread
- **Active hours** — restrict to a daily time window

<Tip>
  **Tip:** Turn on **“Trigger outside of business hours”** to invert the time window for after-hours replies.
</Tip>

### 5. Add **Actions**

Actions run when the conditions match. You can add **one or many** in the order you want them to execute.

- **Reply to message** — send an SMS/MMS (supports templates, tags, and media)
- **Assign teammates to the conversation** — pick one or more users
- **Add labels to the conversation** — apply one or more labels

<Tip>
  **Tip:** You can chain multiple actions together—e.g., **Reply**, **Assign**, and **Label** in a single Relay.
</Tip>

**Delays (optional)**

- Add a **Delay** to **Reply to message** to wait minutes/hours before sending.
- Delays help prevent duplicate auto-replies if a message was sent recently.

### 6. Activate your Relay

Use the **toggle** to turn the Relay **On**. You can pause anytime without losing your setup.

## Managing Relays

### Pause / resume

- From the list: toggle **On/Off**
- From details: use the status toggle at the top

Paused Relays do not evaluate triggers or run actions.

### Delete

Open the Relay → **⋯** → **Delete**.

<Warning>
  **Warning:** Deleting is permanent. If you might reuse the automation, **pause** instead.
</Warning>

## Starter Relay Templates (Copy & Adapt)

### Keyword responder

**Trigger:** Message Received\
**Conditions:** Message contains `SUPPORT`\
**Actions:** Reply →\
“Thanks for reaching out to support. Please share any extra details, and we’ll jump in.”

<Tip>
  **Tip:** Keep keywords short and memorable (e.g., `JOIN`, `BOOK`, `SUPPORT`).
</Tip>

### Identify unknown contacts

**Trigger:** Message Received\
**Conditions:** Is anonymous conversation\
**Actions:** Reply →\
“Thanks for texting us! What’s your first and last name so we know who to help?”

### Assign new conversations

**Trigger:** Message Received\
**Conditions:** Is new conversation\
**Actions:** Assign teammates → pick your queue owner(s)

### Auto-label new threads

**Trigger:** Message Received\
**Conditions:** Is new conversation\
**Actions:** Add labels → e.g., `Support`, `Lead`, `Region: West`

### After-hours auto-reply

**Trigger:** Message Received\
**Conditions:** Active hours (inverted for after-hours)\
**Actions:** Reply →\
“Thanks for texting! We’re away right now. We’ll reply at 8am PT. Reply STOP to opt out.”

## Technical Notes & Behavior

- **Action order:** Actions execute top-to-bottom in the order you add them.
- **Delays:** Units include minutes/hours. Use to prevent duplicate “fast follow” replies.
- **Active hours:** Configure daily windows; invert to run only outside business hours.
- **Permissions aware:** Assign/Label actions respect **Roles & Permissions**.
- **Testing tip:** Start with a single condition/action, confirm it fires, then layer on complexity.

## Frequetly Asked Relay Questions

**Do Relays respect roles & permissions?**\
Yes. Assign/Label actions follow your **Roles & Permissions** settings.

**Can multiple Relays run on one inbound message?**\
Yes. If conditions match for more than one Relay, each eligible Relay can run.

**Can I include media in auto-replies?**\
Yes. Keep each file **≤ 10 MB** (files **\> 500 KB** are sent as links). See [**Media**](/messaging/media).

**Can I pause without losing my setup?**\
Yes—toggle **Off** to pause. Toggle **On** to resume.

**How do I avoid duplicate automated replies?**\
Add a **Delay** to the **Reply** action, or narrow conditions (e.g., “Is new conversation”).

## Troubleshooting

**A Relay didn’t fire**

- Confirm it’s **On** (not paused).
- Verify the **Trigger** is “Message Received”.
- Temporarily loosen **Conditions** (switch `AND` to `OR`, remove a filter) to test.

**Auto-reply sent multiple times**

- Add a **Delay** to your **Reply** action so back-to-back messages don’t both trigger an instant response.

**Assign/Label didn’t apply**

- Check the target user/label permissions.
- Remove long **Delays** while testing to see results immediately.

**Unexpected timing**

- Review **Active hours** and the **invert** setting.
- Check your workspace **timezone**.

---

## Best Practices

- **Be explicit:** Name Relays clearly (e.g., “After-hours reply — Support line”).
- **Document ownership:** Add who maintains the Relay to the description.
- **Start simple:** One trigger → one condition → one action. Expand gradually.
- **Stay compliant:** Include opt-out language (e.g., “Reply **STOP** to opt out”) where appropriate.
