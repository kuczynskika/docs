# How to Create & Edit Relays

Build reliable automations with a clear flow: **Trigger → Conditions → Actions**. This guide shows you how to configure, test, and troubleshoot Relays.

## How to Create or Edit a Relay

### **1. Visit the Relay Module**

Select a **template** to start building a new Relay or edit an existing Relay.

### 2. Name your Relay and give it a description

Give your Relay a descriptive **name** and add a **description**. You can also add an icon.

### 3. Set a trigger

Currently, MessageDesk only supports the **Message Received** trigger. We plan on adding more trigger types in the near future.

### 4. Add conditions

#### **Select a logical operator:**

- Selecting AND means all conditions must be met for the Relay to run.

  Selecting OR means any condition must be met for the Relay to run.

**Select a condition:**

- **Message contains text** (any specified keyword like SUPPORT or HELP)
- **My phone number equals** (a phone line connected to your MessageDesk workspace) 
- **Is anonymous conversation** (a conversation with an anonymous contact)
- **Is new conversation** (any new conversation)
- **Active hours** (times of the day when your Relay is active)

<Tip>
  **Tip**: Select **Trigger outside of business hours** to flip the active hours logic to run _outside of the specified timeframe _(this works great for after-hours replies).
</Tip>

### 5. Add actions

- **Reply to message** (sends an outbound SMS/MMS)
- **Assign teammates to the conversation** (assigns one or more teammates to the conversation)
- **Add labels to the conversation** (Applies one or more labels to the conversation)

<Tip>
  **Tip**: Set a **Delay** for the Reply to message action to delay sending your message for a time after the Relay conditions are met. Delays can help you avoid repeated message sends if a Relay message was sent recently.
</Tip>

## Relay Templates

### Respond to a keyword

Set keywords like SUPPORT to trigger automatic text message responses. You can use any keyword you like to trigger your Relay.

> **Trigger:** Message received
>
> **Conditions: **Message contains text = SUPPORT
>
> **Actions:** Reply to message
>
> T**ext:** "Thanks, this looks like an issue we need to route to support. Are there any other important details we should know here before we start investigating?"

<Tip>
  **Tip:** keep your **keywords** short and memorable 
</Tip>

### Identify unknown conversations and contact

Use this Reply to anonymous conversations with a follow-up asking for info.

> **Trigger:** Message received
>
> **Conditions:** Is anonymous conversation
>
> **Actions:** Reply to message
>
> **Text:** "Hey thanks for texting us - real quick, can you reply with your first name/last name so I know who we're talking to?"

### Assign new conversations to teammates

Use this Relay to assign new conversations to teammates.

> **Trigger:** Message received
>
> **Conditions:** Is new conversation
>
> **Actions:** Assign teammates to the conversation

### Automatically label conversation

Label new conversations automatically for better sorting within your Inbox.

> **Trigger:** Message received
>
> **Conditions:** Is new conversation
>
> **Actions:** Add labels to the conversation

### Out-of-Office (Away) Autoreponse

Text an autoresponse outside of operating/office hours.

> **Trigger:** Message received

>
> **Actions:** Reply to message
>
> **Text:** Hey, thanks for texting us! We're away right now, but we'll be back soon.

## FAQ

**Can I include media in auto-replies?**\

## Troubleshooting

**A Relay didn’t fire.**

- Confirm the **Trigger** is correct
- Check to see if your Relay is **Paused**.
- Loosen **Conditions** (try removing an AND condition temporarily).

**Auto-reply sent multiple times.**

- Add a **Delay** to your Relay.

**Actions didn’t run after conditions matched.**

- Check for **permission limits** (roles) on assignees/labels.
- Remove long **Delays** while testing.

## Best practices

- **Name your Relays clearly:** “After-hours reply – Support line” beats “Relay 1”.
- **Start simple:** One trigger, one condition, one action—then iterate.
- **Document the owner:** Note who maintains each Relay in the description.
