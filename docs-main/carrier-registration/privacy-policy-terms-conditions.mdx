# SMS Privacy Policy Requirements

To get approved for **A2P 10DLC** (local) and to pass **toll-free verification**, carriers require a **public, compliant SMS privacy policy**. Use this guide (plus our downloadable template) to publish yours and keep your messages deliverable.

## What Your SMS Privacy Policy Must Include

- **Data collected:** What you collect (e.g., name, mobile number) and **how** (web forms, keywords, in-store signups).
- **Data usage:** Why you send texts (reminders, order updates, service notices, promotions).
- **Consent & opt-in:** The explicit opt-in method (checkbox text, keyword, form language, written/verbal consent).
- **Opt-out mechanism:** Clear instructions like **“Reply STOP to opt out.”** Include this **in your policy and sample messages**.
- **Third-party sharing:** State you **don’t sell or share** SMS data with third parties for marketing. If you use an SMS provider, say it’s **only to deliver messages**.
- **Security:** High-level measures (encryption, access controls).
- **Retention & deletion:** How long you retain data and how users can **request deletion**.
- **Support contact:** Email and/or phone for privacy inquiries.

<Tip>
  **Tip:** For promotional messaging, get **express written consent**. A **double opt-in** (user enters number → confirm SMS → user replies YES) is strongly recommended.
</Tip>

## Where to Publish (and link) Your Privacy Policy

- Add the policy to your website and link it in the **global footer**.
- Link it anywhere you collect phone numbers:
  - Opt-in forms and checkouts
  - Chatbot flows
  - Landing pages and popups
  - Paper or in-store signups (QR/link)

<Tip>
  **Tip:** Already have a general privacy policy? Add a dedicated **SMS section** covering all points above.

- ❌ Vague purpose → Specify use cases (reminders, order updates, etc.).
- ❌ Website mismatch → Ensure site shows the **same legal name** and address.

## Frequently Asked Privacy Policy Questions

**Do I need a separate policy just for SMS?**\
Not required. You can add an **SMS section** to your existing privacy policy that covers opt-in, opt-out, usage, sharing, retention, and contact.

**Is double opt-in mandatory?**\
No, but it’s recommended for **promotional** messaging and improves compliance evidence.

**Does this apply to toll-free numbers?**\
Yes. **Toll-free verification** is separate, but the same privacy expectations apply.

- ✅ Link it in your **footer** and on **all opt-in forms**.
- ✅ Include **consent flow** and **STOP keywords** in sample messages.
