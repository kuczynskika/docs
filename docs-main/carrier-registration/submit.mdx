# How to Submit Your Carrier Registration with MessaageDesk

Carrier registration is **built into** MessageDesk's phone setup flow. When you configure phone lines, you'll provide your business details, choose how you want to connect numbers, and submit registration—all in one place.

## What You'll Need to Complete Carrier Registration (Quick Checklist)

- **Valid payment method**
- **Legal business name** (exactly as filed, incl. LLC/Inc)
- **EIN** (you can provide your EIN via email; tax documents are only required if manual verification is needed) and **business address** (or sole-prop info if no EIN)
- **Website or public listing** (Facebook, Yelp, etc.)
- **Use-case description** (what you'll send)
- **Three sample SMS messages** (include "Reply **STOP** to opt out" in at least one)
- **Consent method** (web form checkbox, written/verbal, keyword)

<Note>
  **Note:** Are you a Sole proprietor with an EIN? You'll need to complete manual TCR verification with our team (see our [**Carrier Registration Overview**](/carrier-registration/overview) guide).

### 3. Select your phone number type

You have several options for connecting phone numbers to MessageDesk. The type of phone number you choose to connect dictates your carrier registration pathway and timeline.

![Carrier Registration Connect Phone Numbers](/images/carrier-registration-connect-phone-numbers.png)

#### Option 1. Twilio

If you're [connecting a Twilio phone number to MessageDesk](/get-started/phone-numbers/twilio), then we automatically assume you've completed a carrier registration through Twilio's platform. \_In this case, you DO NOT need to complete a second carrier registration through MessageDesk. \_

Twilio will handle all of the delivery and administration of your text messaging. MessageDesk will only act as the front-end inbox interface that you and your team will use to send and receive Twilio messages.

If you have not yet completed carrier registration through Twilio, you may consider hosting an existing number or purchasing a text-only line through MessageDesk and completing a carrier registration through us.

#### Option 2. Host existing phone number (landline, VoIP, or business line)

Select "host existing phone number" if you'd like to bring your existing [business landline numbers and VoIP-connected lines](/get-started/phone-numbers/landline-voip) or [toll-free phone numbers](/get-started/phone-numbers/toll-free) to MessageDesk. MessageDesk works with all business landlines and VoIP providers.

<Warning>
  **Note:** MessageDesk does not support text-enabling or connection with mobile phone numbers. Learn more about support phone number types here.
</Warning>

#### Option 3. Purchase a "text-only" phone number from MessageDesk

You're also free to [purchase "text-only" phone numbers](/get-started/phone-numbers/purchase-new) through MessageDesk. We support all North American area codes.

### 3. Start your 30-day free trial

Select a monthly or yearly MessageDesk plan. This is required to begin carrier registration and to start your 30-day free trial.
