- **Website or public listing** (Facebook, Yelp, etc.)
- **Use-case description** (what you'll send)
- **Three sample SMS messages** (include "Reply **STOP** to opt out" in at least one)
- **Consent method** (web form checkbox, written/verbal, keyword)

<Note>

## How to Begin Carrier Registration in MessageDesk

You can begin the carrier registration process in several ways when logged in to MessageDesk:

### 1. Start from the Inbox Welcome Screen

Click "Add number" or "Get Registered" in the bottom left corner of the inbox.

![Carrier Registration Option 1](/images/carrier-registration-option-1.png)

### 2. (Alternative) click on Account -\> Settings

Navigate to**Phone Management → click "Add Phone Number" to begin** .

![Carrier Registration Option 2](/images/carrier-registration-option-2.png)

### 3. Select your phone number type

You have several options for connecting phone numbers to MessageDesk. The type of phone number you choose to connect dictates your carrier registration pathway and timeline.

![Carrier Registration Connect Phone Numbers](/images/carrier-registration-connect-phone-numbers.png)

**Option 1. Twilio**

If you're [connecting a Twilio phone number to MessageDesk](/get-started/phone-numbers/twilio), then we automatically assume you've completed a carrier registration through Twilio's platform. \_In this case, you DO NOT need to complete a second carrier registration through MessageDesk. \_

Twilio will handle all of the delivery and administration of your text messaging. MessageDesk will only act as the front-end inbox interface that you and your team will use to send and receive Twilio messages.

If you have not yet completed carrier registration through Twilio, you may consider hosting an existing number or purchasing a text-only line through MessageDesk and completing a carrier registration through us.

**Option 2. Host existing phone number (landline, VoIP, or business line)**

Select "host existing phone number" if you'd like to bring your existing [business landline numbers and VoIP-connected lines](/get-started/phone-numbers/landline-voip) or [toll-free phone numbers](/get-started/phone-numbers/toll-free) to MessageDesk. MessageDesk works with all business landlines and VoIP providers.

<Warning>
  **Note:** MessageDesk does not support text-enabling or connection with mobile phone numbers. Learn more about support phone number types here.
</Warning>

**Option 3. Purchase a "text-only" phone number from MessageDesk**

You're also free to [purchase "text-only" phone numbers](/get-started/phone-numbers/purchase-new) through MessageDesk. We support all North American area codes.

### 3. Start your 30-day free trial

Select a monthly or yearly MessageDesk plan. This is required to begin carrier registration and to start your 30-day free trial.

![Start Free Trial](/images/start-free-trial.png)

### 4. Enter your payment details

MessageDesk will then redirect you to a standalone secure payment portal where you can enter your payment details.

  1. **IRS Form W-9** or **Canadian BN document**
  2. **Website** or **social media profile link**
</Note>

### **Enter your contact information**

## Part 2 of 3: SMS Opt-in & Privacy Policy Check

The second part of the carrier registration process helps us establish your current SMS opt-in policies, methods, and documentation in your privacy policy.

### Question 1: Does your website have a privacy policy?

A privacy policy is a document (usually published in a website's footer) that explains, among many things, how your organization collects and uses data and information.

How you collect and use contact information is especially important for carrier registration.

Here's an example privacy policy from the MessageDesk website: https://www.messagedesk.com/privacy

Select **Yes**, if your organization publishes a privacy policy.

Select **No**, if your organization does not publish a privacy policy or if you're not sure.

![Carrier Registration Privacy Policy Question](/images/carrier-registration-privacy-policy-question.png)

Once you select yes, please provide the URL of your published privacy policy.

![Carrier Registration Enter Privacy Policy Url](/images/carrier-registration-enter-privacy-policy-url.png)

### Question 2: Do you use forms on your website to collect phone numbers and other details from contacts?

How you collect contact information and data is equally important to how you use it.

Select **Yes**, if your website has publicly accessible web forms that collect contact information, including phone numbers.

Select **No**, if your website does not publish web forms that collect contact information, or if you collect contact information in other ways, like paper forms, by phone, etc.

![Carrier Registration Question 2](/images/carrier-registration-question-2.png)

Once you select yes, please provide website URL(s) for all forms that collect a phone number. Example: "contact us page". If you don't use forms to collect contact info on your website, please enter "n/a".

![Carrier Registration Form Url](/images/carrier-registration-form-url.png)

## Part 3 of 3: **How You Use SMS Text Messaging**

This section of the carrier registration form helps us establish your messaging volume, the types of messages you intend to send/receive, and your overall messaging use case.

### Question 1: How many text messages will you send per month?

Example: You text your contacts twice each month and have 10,000 contacts. That would be around 20,000 monthly text messages.

![Carrier Registration Volume](/images/carrier-registration-volume.png)

### Question 2: Who will your organization be texting?

Selecting the types of people you will receive/send messages to helps us establish your messaging use case with the carriers.

<Note>
  **Note:** Be sure to select all that apply.
</Note>

![Carrier Registration Who](/images/carrier-registration-who.png)

### Question 3: How do you intend to use SMS in your organization?

Selecting how you intend to use text messaging (i.e., the purpose of your messages) helps us further establish your messaging use case with the carriers.

<Note>
  **Note:** Be sure to select all that apply.
</Note>

![Carrier Registration How](/images/carrier-registration-how.png)

### Question 4: (1 of 3) Please provide an example of a text message you send.

Carriers require us to submit examples of the types of messages you intend to send. They ask this to help verify your messaging use case and intent.

<Warning>
  **Note:** Your example text messages MUST match how you actually intend to use SMS.

  **Example**: If marked that you will send SMS for appointment reminders, then your example messages must include at least one example of an appointment reminder text message.
</Warning>

![Carrier Registration Example Message](/images/carrier-registration-example-message.png)

### Question 5: Will you ever include a URL or link to a webpage in the body of your text messages?

This question is important because it affects how we register your campaign with carriers. If you do send links in your text messages, but you DO NOT mark yes, then your messages may fail to deliver.

<Warning>
  **Note:** For the best possible delivery, we highly suggest you **select Yes** to this question and provide an example text message that includes a link.
</Warning>

![Carrier Registration Links](/images/carrier-registration-links.png)

![Carrier Registration Link Example](/images/carrier-registration-link-example.png)

### Question 6: Will you ever send a phone number in the body of your text messages?

This question is also important because it affects how we register your campaign with carriers. If you do include phone numbers in your text messages, but you DO NOT mark yes, then your messages may fail to deliver.

<Warning>
  **Note:** For the best possible delivery, we highly suggest you **select Yes** to this question and provide an example text message that includes a phone number.
</Warning>

## Carrier Registration Phone Number Options

For all A2P 10DLC carrier registrations, you have two phone number options:

1. Purchase a new text-only phone number from MessageDesk.
2. Host an existing landline, VoIP, or non-mobile business phone line.

<Note>
  **Note:** these options exclude toll-free carrier registration, which has its own approval process.
</Note>

<Warning>
  **Note:** Your answers in the section of the carrier registration questionnaire are for **internal informational purposes only**. You will complete phone line configuration separately once your carrier registration is approved.
</Warning>

![Carrier Registration Phone Number Options](/images/carrier-registration-phone-number-options.png)

### Purchase a new phone number

MessageDesk makes it easy to purchase text-only 10-digit North American phone numbers (with any area code of your choosing).

To purchase a new number, let us know:

1. How many phone numbers you'd like to purchase.
2. Your preferred area code(s) for these numbers.
3. The closest city/town related to these area codes (sometimes this matters for larger urban areas).

![Carrier Registration Purchase Numbers](/images/carrier-registration-purchase-numbers.png)

### Host an existing phone number

MessageDesk makes it possible to:

1. Text-enable existing business landlines or VoIP numbers.
2. Text-enable existing phone numbers already tied to a business texting provider.

<Note>
  **Note:** when using your existing business landline or VoIP numbers, MessageDesk works directly with your provider to route SMS sent/received on your existing numbers to MessageDesk.

  This type of configuration is called **"Number Hosting"**. It does not alter or change your existing voice setup or configuration in any way.
</Note>

<Warning>
  **Note:** MessageDesk does not support texting with existing phone numbers tied to mobile devices or Google Voice. Mobile carriers like Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile, etc., are reluctant to release these numbers since they're tied directly to mobile devices.

  Check out this doc for [more info on number hosting vs. porting](/get-started/phone-numbers/overview).
</Warning>

![Carrier Registration Host Existing](/images/carrier-registration-host-existing.png)

Separate multiple entries with a comma and space or add a line break\
Example: (555)123-4567, (552)987-6543).
