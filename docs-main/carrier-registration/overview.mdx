## Carrier Registration Basics

### What is carrier registration?

**A2P 10DLC** is how U.S. carriers verify businesses that text from **local 10-digit numbers**. Registration tells carriers **who you are** and **what you send**, which improves deliverability and reduces filtering. If you text from **toll-free numbers**, you’ll complete **Toll-Free Verification** (separate process).

### Who needs to register?

- Any business texting **U.S. recipients** from **local (10DLC)** numbers in MessageDesk.
- **Sole proprietors (no EIN)** can register (with limits).
- **Sole proprietors with an EIN** require **manual TCR verification** (details below).
- **Toll-free** numbers require **toll-free verification** per number.

<Note>
  **Note:** Businesses/organizations texting just within Canada (never sending to U.S.-based numbers are currently **exempt** from carrier registration.
</Note>

### How long does carrier registration it take?

- **For a Business with an (EIN):** typically **5–7 business days**
- **For a Sole Proprietor (no EIN):** typically **1–3 business days**
- **For Toll-Free Verification:** typically **2–3 weeks**

<Note>
  **Note: **Timelines vary if information can’t be verified on the first pass.

## Special Case: Sole proprietor **with** an EIN (manual TCR)

If you’re a sole proprietor who **has an EIN**, you **cannot** use the standard automated sole-prop path. You’ll need **manual TCR verification** as a **private profit entity**.

**You’ll need:**

- **W-9** showing your EIN
- **IRS EIN letter** (official confirmation)
- Business info that matches tax records

**Process:**

1. Send your documents to **MessageDesk Support**.
2. We’ll create your brand in **TCR** and open a support ticket.
3. TCR manually verifies your brand.
4. Once verified, we submit your campaign.

**Notes:**

- Without the **IRS EIN letter**, your brand will remain unverified in TCR.
- You won’t register “as a sole prop” inside TCR; you’ll be verified as a **private profit entity**.
- If you’re missing the letter, request a copy from the **IRS**.

**Alternative:** Convert to an **LLC** (e.g., via LegalZoom) and register as a typical business with EIN.
