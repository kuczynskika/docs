## **Why move to Inbox by MessageDesk?**

Migrating to Inbox by MessageDesk gives your team a messaging platform built for collaboration, control, and clarity.

- **Superior Media Support**\
  Never force users to “just email it.” V2 lets you send and receive PDFs, DOCs, JPEGs, PNGs, GIFs, WEBPs, HEICs, and more. Files larger than ~500 KB automatically convert to links, and all attachments are managed in one place. No more disjointed media handling.
- **Group Texting & 1:1 Conversations**\
   You get the flexibility to communicate how a real team does. Start a 1:1 conversation or include up to 7 recipients in a group text, without duplicating effort or context.
- **User Access Controls & Customization**\
  You’re not locked into a one-size-fits-all inbox. Inbox by MessageDesk lets you set up custom user roles and permissions, comment internally, @mention teammates, and tailor inbox views. Dark mode, custom theming, and saved filters round out a workspace that adapts to how your team works.
- **Better Organization & Routing**\
  Gone are the days of scattered messaging. In Inbox by MessageDesk, you can label conversations freely, filter, route, or assign messages as a unified team.

## **At a glance**

- **Total time:** ~15–30 minutes to prepare; number migration is scheduled during business hours (see Step 5).
- **Who’s involved:** An account owner/admin and any teammates who will use Inbox.
- **What moves:** Your existing phone number (after you complete the setup steps). Contacts can be exported/imported.

## **What you’ll need**

- The email address you want to use for your Inbox login.
- A list of teammates to invite (names and emails).
- A preferred **day and time (Mon–Fri, 9am–5pm)** for number migration.

## **Step 1 — Create your Inbox account**

1. Go to [**<u>https://inbox.messagedesk.com/#/create-account</u>**](https://inbox.messagedesk.com/#/create-account)** **

**Tip:** Use your email already attached to your old MessageDesk account

## **Step 2 — Invite your team**

2. In the left-hand menu, click **Team**.
3. Select **Invite Teammate** and send invites to everyone who will use Inbox by MessageDesk.

**Why this matters:** We’ll only move your number **after** your team is in place. That way, messages are immediately visible to the right people when your number goes live in Inbox.

## **Step 3 — Export contacts from your Reach workspace**

If you’d like to bring existing contacts with you:

1. Sign in to your old account at [**app.messagedesk.com**](http://app.messagedesk.com).
2. Export your contacts (.CSV is great).
