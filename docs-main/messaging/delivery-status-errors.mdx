# Message Delivery Status & Errors

See what’s happening with every outbound message—and know exactly how to manage message delivery failures.

---

## TL;DR

- **Outbound messages** show a status next to the timestamp (e.g., **Sent**, **Delivered**, **Failed**).
- **Inbound messages** show a **timestamp only** (no delivery status).
- **Failed** messages include a **reason** and quick actions: **Resend**, **Contact support**, **Delete**.

## Individual Message Statuses (1:1, Group SMS, or “Send Individually” Broadcasts)

| Status (UI)   | What it means                               |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Created**   | Message created and preparing to send.      |
| **Queued**    | Message queued for delivery.                |
| **Sent**      | Handed off to carriers.                     |
| **Delivered** | Carrier confirmed handset delivery.         |
| **Failed**    | Could not deliver. Click for error details. |

<Note>
  **Note:** Status appears on **outbound** messages. **Inbound** messages don’t display delivery states.

## The most common reasons messages fail (and how to fix them)

1. **Texting a landline that's not text-enabled**\
   A text to a **landline** will fail because the destination isn’t SMS-capable. Verify the number is a **mobile** number and format it in **E.164** (e.g., `+15551234567`).

   _Related errors:_ **Invalid Number** (Code 2), **Destination Unreachable** (Code 5).\
   [When you text a landline, typically nothing happens.](https://www.messagedesk.com/blog/text-to-landline)
2. **Carriers are flagging content they believe is spammy or in violation of your campaign terms**\
   Carriers may reject messages flagged as **spam**—common triggers include generic short links, all caps, repetitive promos, or missing consent/opt-out language.

   _Related errors:_ **Anti-spam** (Code 4), **Invalid Message** (Code 3), **Invalid Short Link** (Code 13).\
   Follow [TCPA guidelines and best practices](https://www.messagedesk.com/blog/tcpa-compliance), include **Reply STOP to opt out**, and prefer full or branded URLs.
3. **Carrier network or throughput limits**\
   High send volume or unregistered numbers can hit **rate limits** or encounter **carrier errors**.

   _Related errors:_ **Carrier Error** (Code 7), **Rate Limit Exceeded** (Code 16), **Unregistered 10DLC** (Code 14), **Pending Registration** (Code 17), **Campaign Suspended** (Code 18).\
   **Tip:** For higher volume, register your local number for **A2P 10DLC**, or ask about using a **verified toll-free** number. Verified toll-free often supports higher throughput and fewer filters.

## Failure Reasons (Error Codes) & What to Do

Click a **Failed** status to see the specific reason and take action.

| Code   | Error text (UI)         | What it means                                                          | What you should do                                                               |
| -----: | ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1**  | Unknown Error           | Generic failure.                                                       | Retry once. If it persists, **Contact support** with the conversation link/time. |
| **2**  | Invalid Number          | The number isn’t associated with any carrier (often landline or typo). | Verify the number is mobile or text-enabled; fix to **E.164** format.            |
| **3**  | Invalid Message         | Carrier marked content invalid.                                        | Remove blocked phrases/formatting; ensure compliance; resend.                    |
| **4**  | Anti-spam               | Carrier flagged as spam.                                               | Add opt-out, reduce links/ALL-CAPS, segment sends; ensure 10DLC.                 |
| **5**  | Destination Unreachable | Number not valid on the network.                                       | Confirm with the contact; update or remove.                                      |
| **6**  | Insufficient Funds      | Billing/credits issue.                                                 | Update payment; retry after funds post.                                          |

| **8**  | Media Error             | Unsupported or corrupt media.                                          | Re-attach supported types; keep each file ≤ **10 MB**.                           |
| **10** | Opted Out               | Recipient opted out.                                                   | Do **not** resend. Re-opt-in via a compliant flow if appropriate.                |
| **11** | Blocked                 | Recipient or your workspace blocked messaging.                         | Unblock only if appropriate and compliant.                                       |

| **16** | Rate Limit Exceeded     | Throughput/daily caps hit.                                             | Schedule in waves; upgrade throughput via carrier registration.                  |

## How statuses appear in the UI

- **Outbound:** `10:42 AM | Delivered ✓` (timestamp **|** status + icon).
- **Failed:** Error styling; click to open details and **Resend**.
- **Media:** Status shows even without text content.
- **Inbound:** Timestamp only (no status).

---

## What you can do (quick actions)

- **Resend message:** Try again after fixing the cause.
- **Contact support:** Opens a pre-filled path with thread details.
- **Delete message:** Removes the failed item from the thread (history remains).

---

## Best practices to avoid failures

- **Register your numbers:** Use **A2P 10DLC** for local lines; **verify toll-free** for higher volume.
- **Compliant content:** Include opt-out language on non-conversational sends; avoid spammy wording and generic short links.
- **Clean data:** Store numbers in **E.164** and confirm the destination is **mobile**, not landline.
- **Right-size media:** Keep each file ≤ **10 MB**; files \> **500 KB** are sent as links automatically.
- **Throttle large sends:** Use **Schedule** to send in waves and prevent rate limiting.

## Frequently Asked Message Delivery Questions

**Do inbound messages ever show a delivery status?**\
No. Only outbound messages display delivery states.

**What’s the difference between “Sent” and “Delivered”?**\
**Sent** = handed to the carrier. **Delivered** = carrier confirmed handset receipt.

**How can I tell if I texted a landline?**\
Failures with an **Invalid Number** or **Destination Unreachable** often indicate a landline or bad number. Confirm with the contact and update.

**Why do short links get blocked?**\
Carriers frequently filter generic shorteners. Use **full** or **branded** links.

**Does 10DLC apply to me?**\
Yes for most US local business texting. Register to improve deliverability and reduce filtering.

**How long does “Pending Registration” last?**\
Typically **up to 24 hours** for association and carrier propagation.

---

## Troubleshooting Message Delivery

**Status shows “Unknown.”**\
Retry once. If repeated, **Contact support** with the conversation link/time.

**Delivered, but no reply.**\
Delivery ≠ read. Consider a concise follow-up; verify the number and opt-out status.

**Spike in failed sends during a blast.**\
Review content for compliance, ensure **10DLC/toll-free** registration, and **schedule** in smaller batches.

**Uploading and sending media keeps failing.**\
Confirm file type/size (≤ **10 MB**). Re-attach or compress; avoid corrupted files.

**Consistent Invalid Number errors.**\
Normalize numbers to **E.164** and validate country codes. Landlines will fail; request a mobile number.
