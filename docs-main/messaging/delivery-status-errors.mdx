## **The most common reasons why text messages fail to send**

1. The number the text message was sent to is a landline.
2. The message contained something in the content that a carrier flagged as SPAM.
3. The message failed due to a carrier network error (typically associated with bulk message sends).

### **1. Texting a Landline**

**A text message sent from MessageDesk will fail if you're texting a phone number associated with a landline.**

As a best practice, make sure the number you're texting is a verified mobile number capable of receiving text messages.

[When you text a landline, typically nothing happens](https://www.messagedesk.com/blog/text-to-landline). In some instances, the landline service will interpret text messages, but this is not a given.

### **2. Texting Spammy Content**

**A text message sent from MessageDesk will fail if the message contains what carriers interpret as SPAM.**

****_____A carrier may not deliver a message because of specific keywords or because you've included a suspicious-looking link._____****

When it comes to SPAM, you'll want to follow all [TCPA guidelines and best practices](https://www.messagedesk.com/blog/tcpa-compliance).

### **3. Carrier Network Errors**

Carrier network errors are relatively infrequent, but they can prevent your text message from reaching the recipient.

Typically, carrier network errors occur when there is a lot of message volume

Certain phone numbers can only send a certain number of messages at one time.

Exceeding this limit can cause network errors and create problems with message delivery.

**_For higher volume message sends, ask about switching your 10-digit MessageDesk number to a high-volume 1-800 number._**
