# Message Delivery Errors & Troubleshooting

Get messages through, fast. This guide shows you **what each status means**, **how to fix failures**, and **what to send support** if you need help.

---

## TL;DR — Your Fastest Path to Fix Messaging Problems

1. **Open the status badge.** If it’s **Failed**, tap to see the error reason.
2. **Retry smartly.** Send a short, **plain-text** message **without links or media**.
3. **Check the basics.** Is the number **mobile** and formatted **E.164** (`+15551234567`)?
4. **Registration matters.** Make sure your line is **A2P 10DLC-registered** (local) or **verified** (toll-free).
5. **If urgent, use another channel** (call/email) while you troubleshoot.

## What Message Delivery Statuses Mean + What to Do

| Status        | What it means                               | What you should do                                                                                                 |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Delivered** | Carrier confirmed delivery.                 | If your contact says “didn’t get your message,” resend a short message **without links or media**.                 |
| **Sent**      | Handed to carriers; final delivery pending. | Wait for an update. Carriers don’t always reply with a delivery status; if it stays “Sent,” try a short follow-up. |
| **Queued**    | Throttled to protect deliverability.        | Leave it; the queue clears automatically. Heavy team usage on one line may extend queue time.                      |
| **Failed**    | Carrier/network rejected delivery.          | Use the **error reason** below → fix → **Resend**.                                                                 |

<Note>
  **Inbound** messages show a **timestamp only** (no delivery status).
</Note>

## Top 3 Reasons Messages Fail + Fixes

1. **Landline or unreachable number**
   - Signs: **Invalid Number (2)**, **Destination Unreachable (5)**
   - Fix: Confirm it’s a **mobile** number; correct formatting to **E.164**; request an updated number if needed.
2. **Content filtered as spam / out of campaign scope**
   - Signs: **Anti-spam (4)**, **Invalid Message (3)**, **Invalid Short Link (13)**
   - Fix: Remove short links, ALL CAPS, and promo buzzwords. Add identity + **“Reply STOP to opt out.”** Use full or branded URLs.
3. **Throughput or registration limits**
   - Signs: **Carrier Error (7)**, **Rate Limit Exceeded (16)**, **Unregistered 10DLC (14)**, **Pending Registration (17)**, **Campaign Suspended (18)**
   - Fix: Complete **10DLC** or **toll-free verification**. **Schedule** large sends in waves. Contact support if suspended.
