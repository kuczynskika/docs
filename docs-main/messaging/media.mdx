## How to Attach Media to a Message _or_ a Comment

Attaching media works the same way in **Messaging** mode and **Comment** mode—the button and steps are identical.

1. In the message compose box, click the **\+** icon.

2. Choose one:
   - **Upload from your computer** or **Insert a GIF**
   - **Drag & drop** the file into the composer, or click to browse your folders
   - **Select from existing Workspace files** (see next section)
3. Confirm the file appears above the composer.
4. (Optional) Click the **x** on a media item to remove it.
5. **Send** the message or **Save** the comment.

<Note>
  **Pro tip:** You can **copy/paste** images directly into the compose box with **Cmd + V** (macOS) or **Ctrl + V** (Windows/Linux).

  **Heads up:** If you use a screen capture tool like CleanShot X, paste behavior may differ.
</Note>

## Insert Media from Existing Workspace Files

Reusing a file you’ve already uploaded keeps things consistent and fast.

1. Click the **\+** icon in the composer.
2. Open the **Workspace files** tab.
3. Browse or search, then **select** your media.
4. The file attaches to your draft—send when ready.

## Where Media Works in MessageDesk

- **1-on-1 messages** – send photos, PDFs, and more to a single contact
- **Broadcasts (send individually)** – attach the same file to each recipient’s message
- **Group SMS** – share media that everyone in the group can see
- **Internal comments** – add files teammates can reference inside the thread

---

## Tips for Smooth Sending

- Keep each file **≤ 10 MB**. Split large PDFs or compress images if needed.
- Use **.jpg** for photos and **.pdf** for documents/forms.
- **HEIC** (common on iPhone) is supported; convert to **.jpg** if a recipient can’t open HEIC.
- Preview before sending to ensure the right file is attached—remove with the **x** if needed.

## How to download images

**On mobile:**
- Force-touch (long press) an image and choose **Save Image**
- Or tap an image to view it full screen, then tap the **download icon** in the top right

**On desktop:**
- Click the **download button** on any image to save it directly to your computer
