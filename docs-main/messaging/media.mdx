# Send, Receive & Share Multi-Media Files with MessageDesk

Add pictures, PDFs, GIFs, HEIC photos, and even contact cards to any message or internal comment. You can upload new files or reuse files already saved in your workspace—without leaving the thread.

## Supported Media File Types

- **.jpg**
- **.png**
- **.gif**
- **.pdf**
- **.heic**
- **.vcf** (contact card)

<Note>
  **Note:** Files **over 500 KB** automatically send as **clickable links**. Your recipient taps the link to view or download the file.
</Note>

## How to Attach Media to a Message _or_ a Comment

Attaching media works the same way in **Messaging** mode and **Comment** mode—the button and steps are identical.

1. In the message compose box, click the **\+** icon.

2. Choose one:
   - **Upload from your computer** or **insert a GIF**
   - **Drag & drop** the file into the composer, or click to browse your folders
   - **Select from existing Workspace files** (see next section)
3. Confirm the file appears above the composer.
4. (Optional) Click the **x** on a media item to remove it.
5. **Send** the message or **Save** the comment.

<Note>
  **Protip:** You can copy/paste images directly into the Message Compose box. Just hit **Ctrl + V** or **Cmd + V**, to add your images. 

  **Note:** If you use a screen capture tool like CleanShotX, this functionality may not work.

## Insert media from existing Workspace files

Reusing a file you’ve already uploaded keeps things consistent and fast.

1. Click the **\+** icon in the composer.
2. Open the **Workspace files** tab.
3. Browse or search, then **select** your media.
4. The file attaches to your draft—send when ready.

## Where media works in MessageDesk

- **1-on-1 messages** – send photos, PDFs, and more to a single contact
- **Broadcasts (send individually)** – attach the same file to each recipient’s message
- **Group SMS** – share media that everyone in the group can see
- **Internal comments** – add files teammates can reference inside the thread

## Tips for smooth sending

- Keep files reasonably sized. Larger files will convert to secure links automatically.
- Use **.jpg** for photos and **.pdf** for documents and forms.
- **HEIC** images (common on iPhone) are supported; consider converting to JPG if a recipient can’t open HEICs on older devices.
- Preview before sending to ensure the right file is attached—remove with the **x** if needed.
