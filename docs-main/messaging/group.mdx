When you need to reach your team or customers, picking the right messaging style is like choosing between a huddle and a megaphone. Here’s how to decide which fits your needs.

## **Group Messaging**

Group messaging is a text thread where everyone sees each other’s responses.

- **Best for:** Small, collaborative discussions (like a quick team check-in).
- **How it works:** All replies go to everyone in the group.
- **Limits:** Up to 10 people per group. Hard to add or remove people once started.
- **Heads up:** Every reply notifies everyone—can get noisy fast.

**Pros:**

- Creates a shared conversation where everyone can participate.
- Works well for small, collaborative discussions.

**Cons:**

- Every reply alerts all recipients (which can quickly become noisy).
- Limited to **10 total participants**.
- Difficult to add or remove participants after the group is created.

## **1-to-Many Broadcast Messaging**

**This is your megaphone.** You send one message to many, but replies stay private.

- **Best for:** Announcements, reminders, or alerts (no group chat needed).
- **How it works:** Reach up to 100 people at once. Each reply starts a private conversation between the recipient and your Inbox.
- **Flexible:** Easily add or remove people from your list.
- **Heads up:** No shared thread—recipients can’t talk to each other.

**Pros:**

- Reach up to **100 recipients** at once.
- Each employee’s reply starts a **private conversation** (no reply-all noise).
- Recipient lists can be updated dynamically—add or remove people easily.
- Ideal for announcements, reminders, or alerts where conversation isn’t needed.

**Cons:**

- Doesn’t create a shared thread where employees can talk to each other.
- Better suited for one-way communication rather than group collaboration.
