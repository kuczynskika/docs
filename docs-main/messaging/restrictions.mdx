# Forbidden Messaging Types (SHAFT-C) for SMS

Carriers block certain message types by default. Use this guide to avoid rejections and stay compliant.

## What’s always prohibited

Do not send these via SMS/MMS:

- High‑risk financial services (payday/short‑term/high‑interest loans, third‑party auto/mortgage/student loans, crypto). Also avoid links to donation sites.
- Third‑party lead generation (buying, selling, or sharing consumer data). No cold outreach without prior consent.
- Debt collection (by third parties), consolidation, reduction, or credit repair programs.
- “Get rich quick,” risky investment pitches, multi‑level marketing (MLM).
- Illegal substances (cannabis/marijuana, prescription drugs not OTC, vaping; CBD is not permitted by US carriers).

## SHAFT‑C: content blocked or restricted

- Sexually inappropriate content (adult/explicit).
- Hate speech or profanity.
- Alcohol: allowed only with proper age‑gating; permitted on Toll‑Free, Short Code, and Long Code.
- Firearms and depictions/endorsements of violence: allowed only with age‑gating; permitted on Toll‑Free, Short Code, and Long Code.
- Tobacco: prohibited on Toll‑Free; allowed on Short Code and Long Code only with age‑gating. Vaping is prohibited everywhere.
- Cannabis: prohibited for US messaging (federally illegal; CBD not allowed by carriers).

## Special requirements for alcohol and beverage businesses

If you operate a brewery, beverage distributor, liquor store, or similar alcohol-related business, you must follow these additional requirements:

**Age-gated opt-in requirements:**
- Your website must have an age gate with manual date of birth (DOB) entry.
- All opt-in forms must include age-gated elements, such as entering DOB or proof of being 21+.
- Simple checkboxes stating "I am 21+" are not sufficient.

**Prohibited messaging content:**
Even with proper age-gating in place, carriers will block messages containing promotional keywords related to alcohol purchases. Do not send messages with phrases like:
- "Buy XYZ beer"
- "Liquor sale"
- "Purchase wine"
- Similar direct purchase language for alcoholic beverages

These keywords trigger carrier-level delivery issues and will result in message filtering or blocking, regardless of your registration status.

**What you can send:**
- Event notifications (e.g., "Join us for our tasting event this Saturday")
- General updates about your business
- Order status notifications (without promotional purchase language)
- Delivery and order reminders

## Gambling

- Prohibited on Toll‑Free.
- Allowed on Short Code or Long Code only with proper age‑gating.
