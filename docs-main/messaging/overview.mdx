- 2FA (two-factor) (receive-only)

<Note>
  **Import historical messages:** You can import past messages into MessageDesk to maintain conversation continuity. Learn more in the [Data Center](/settings/data-center) documentation.
</Note>

## SMS character limits and message segments

Standard SMS messages are limited to **160 characters per segment**. If a message exceeds this limit, carriers automatically split it into multiple segments. Most modern phones display these as a single continuous message, but in rare cases they may appear as separate texts or arrive out of order.

**Special characters reduce the limit:** Emojis and accented letters (like "á" or "ñ") use more data per character. When these are included, the effective limit per segment drops to around **70–80 characters**.

**Automatic MMS conversion:** Once a message reaches approximately three segments, MessageDesk automatically converts it to MMS. This reduces carrier costs and ensures delivery as one complete message regardless of length.

<Note>
  **You don't need to worry about character counts.** MessageDesk includes unlimited messaging and automatic MMS conversion, so your contacts will almost always receive your message as one clean, professional text—even if it technically splits behind the scenes.
</Note>

### 1-on-1 individual text messages

Private, one-to-one messages with a single contact. Each conversation is its own thread in your shared inbox, so your team has full context and can assign, filter, and follow up without stepping on each other.

**Best for:** Conversational, back-and-forth service and support.

**How 1-on-1 individual messages work:** You text one person. Their replies stay in the same private thread.

**Advantages:**

- Keep conversations private and easy to follow.
- Route and assign to the right teammate from the shared inbox.
- Great for personalized, contextual help.

**Limitations:**

- One conversation at a time.
- Not efficient for announcements to many people.

### 1-to-many text message broadcasts

Your megaphone—send one message to many contacts at once. Replies come back as **private 1-on-1** threads so you can triage and follow up quickly. (This is why broadcasts scale _and_ stay personal.)

**Best for:** Announcements, reminders, alerts, promotions.

**How broadcasts work:** Create a group/list and send. Every reply opens a private thread for you.

**Advantages:**

- Reach many people with one send.
- Every reply is private—no “reply all” disasters.
- Combine with templates and scheduling for speed.

**Limitations:**

- Currently limited to **100 contacts per send**.
- Best for one-way notices; not for group collaboration.
- Be mindful of consent and opt-out language for non-conversational texts.

<Note>
  **Pro tip:** Segment first. Targeted broadcasts get better engagement and fewer opt-outs.

### Group SMS

Group SMS messages create a text thread where all message recipients can see and respond to all messages within the text thread.

![group-vs-broadcast-sms](/images/image.png)

**Best for:** Small, collaborative discussions (like a quick team check-in).

**How Group SMS works:** All replies go to everyone in the group.

**Advantages:**

- Creates a shared conversation where everyone can see, respond, and participate.
- Works well for small, collaborative discussions.

**Limitations:**

- Every reply alerts all recipients (which can quickly become noisy).
- Limited to **7 total participants - not including the sender**.
- Difficult to add or remove participants after the group is created.

### Multimedia text messages (MMS)

Multimedia text messages, or MMS for short, are available for all messaging types. You can attach media to individual, broadcast, and group text message conversations.

**Best for:** Visual messages like

**How multimedia text messaging works:** Attach your media to any text message and send.

**Advantages:**

- Faster than email for “show me” moments.
- Reduces back-and-forth and shortens resolution time.

**Limitations:**

- Carrier media file size limits apply.

### 2FA (two-factor) authentication text messages

These are transactional **codes typically sent from a 5- or 6-digit short code**. MessageDesk connected numbers can **only receive** 2FA codes from shortcode phone numbers.

**Best for:** Receiving account-security codes on a shared team number.

\*\*How 2FA messaging works: \*\*Your connected number receives 2FA messages like any other text.

**Advantages:**

- Keep security-related messages in the same customer thread.
- Maintain a record alongside other messages in your shared inbox.

**Limitations:**

- MessageDesk connected phone numbers are only capable of receiving these types of text messages, not generating them or sending from a shortcode phone number.
- **Major carriers block 2FA codes from large organizations** (e.g., Facebook, Amazon, Google, financial institutions) when sent to VoIP numbers. This is a carrier-level restriction, not a MessageDesk limitation.
- **Test before relying on this workflow:** Send a test 2FA code to your MessageDesk number before committing to this use case. Smaller organizations and internal systems typically work fine, but codes from major platforms are often blocked.

<Warning>
  **Security note:** Using a shared team number for 2FA codes bypasses the security model of two-factor authentication. This workflow is best suited for business scenarios like bookkeeping access, audit teams, or internal system logins—not for personal account security.
</Warning>

### Internal comments

Leave private notes right inside a text message conversation. Contacts never see these; they’re team-only for handoffs and internal support.

**Best for:** Handoffs, support, approvals—anything your contact shouldn’t see.

**How internal comments work:** Add a comment to the thread; assign/mention teammates.

**Advantages:**

- Keep the context within the conversation.
- Reduce “who said what” confusion across shifts.

**Limitations:**

- Only visible to MessageDesk users within your MessageDesk workspace.

### Emoji reactions

Add emoji reactions to messages and non-threaded comments to quickly acknowledge, respond, or express sentiment without typing a full reply. Reactions appear in the top-left of the message or comment with a count of unique reactions.

**Best for:** Quick acknowledgments, expressing sentiment, reducing message noise.

**How emoji reactions work:** Hover over a message or comment and select an emoji to react. Click the reaction icon to see all reactions and who posted them.

**Advantages:**

- Acknowledge messages without cluttering the thread with replies.
- See who reacted by clicking the reaction icon.

**Limitations:**

- Available on messages and non-threaded comments only.

### RCS, WhatsApp, Email (coming soon)

These channels will appear as additional conversation types when available. You’ll manage them from the same shared inbox alongside SMS.
