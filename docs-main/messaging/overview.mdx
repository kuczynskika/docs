### 1-on-1 individual text messages

Private, one-to-one messages with a single contact. Each conversation is its own thread in your shared inbox, so your team has full context and can assign, filter, and follow up without stepping on each other.

**Best for:** Conversational, back-and-forth service and support.

**How 1-on-1 individual messages work:** You text one person. Their replies stay in the same private thread.

**Advantages:**

- Keep conversations private and easy to follow.
- Route and assign to the right teammate from the shared inbox.
- Great for personalized, contextual help.

**Limitations:**

- One conversation at a time.
- Not efficient for announcements to many people.

### 1-to-many text message broadcasts

Your megaphone—send one message to many contacts at once. Replies come back as **private 1-on-1** threads so you can triage and follow up quickly. (This is why broadcasts scale _and_ stay personal.)

**Best for:** Announcements, reminders, alerts, promotions.

**How broadcasts work:** Create a group/list and send. Every reply opens a private thread for you.

**Advantages:**

- Reach many people with one send.
- Every reply is private—no “reply all” disasters.
- Combine with templates and scheduling for speed.

**Limitations:**

- Currently limited to **100 contacts per send**.
- Best for one-way notices; not for group collaboration.
- Be mindful of consent and opt-out language for non-conversational texts.

<Note>
  **Pro tip:** Segment first. Targeted broadcasts get better engagement and fewer opt-outs.

### Group SMS

Group SMS messages create a text thread where all message recipients can see and respond to all messages within the text thread.

**Best for:** Small, collaborative discussions (like a quick team check-in).

**How Group SMS works:** All replies go to everyone in the group.

**Advantages:**

- Creates a shared conversation where everyone can see, respond, and participate.
- Works well for small, collaborative discussions.

**Limitations:**

- Every reply alerts all recipients (which can quickly become noisy).
- Limited to **7 total participants - not including the sender**.
- Difficult to add or remove participants after the group is created.

### 2FA (two-factor) authentication text messages

These are transactional **codes typically sent from a 5- or 6-digit short code**. MessageDesk connected numbers can **only receive** 2FA codes from shortcode phone numbers.

**Best for:** Receiving account-security codes on a shared team number.

\*\*How 2FA messaging works: \*\*Your connected number receives 2FA messages like any other text.

**Advantages:**

- Keep security-related messages in the same customer thread.
- Maintain a record alongside other messages in your shared inbox.

**Limitations:**

- MessageDesk connected phone numbers are only capable of receiving these types of text messages, not generating them or sending from a shortcode phone number.

### Internal comments

Leave private notes right inside a text message conversation. Contacts never see these; they’re team-only for handoffs and internal support.

**Best for:** Handoffs, support, approvals—anything your contact shouldn’t see.

**How internal comments work:** Add a comment to the thread; assign/mention teammates.

**Advantages:**

- Keep the context within the conversation.
- Reduce “who said what” confusion across shifts.

**Limitations:**

- Only visible to MessageDesk users within your MessageDesk workspace.
