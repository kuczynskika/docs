# Compose & Send New Messages in MessageDesk

You can send a quick 1-on-1, a small group text, or a one-to-many broadcast right from the **New message** composer. This guide shows you what each field does, the limits to keep in mind, and a few power-tips so you can move fast.

## At a Glance: What Makes up a New Message

- **Recipients** – who you’re sending to
- **Send from** – which connected phone number you’re sending from
- **Message** – your text, plus options for template, media, and emoji
- **Send options** – send now or schedule for later

## How to Compose and Send a New Message from MessageDesk

### 1. Click the **New Message** button from the Inbox

### 2. Add recipients

Search and add people by **name** or **phone number**. As you add them, you’ll see each recipient appear as a **chip** beneath the field to confirm they’re included.

**Pro tips:**

- **Copy/Paste a list of numbers:** You can copy/paste a list of phone numbers directly into the Recipients field. This works great for quick broadcasts.
- **Per-send limit:** You can add **up to 100 recipients** to a single message send.
- **Editing:** Remove anyone by clicking the “x” on their chip before you send.
- **More:** click + more to view all recipient phone numbers

### 3. Select the phone number you want to send from

Choose the [**connected phone number**](/get-started/phone-numbers/overview) you want to send from. You’ll see a dropdown of the **active numbers** available in your workspace.

- Pick the number your contacts expect to hear from.
- If you don’t see a number, confirm it’s connected and active for your workspace.

### 4. Compose your message

This is where you compose and configure what you’re sending.

#### Select a message type

- **Send individually**
  - Sends one message to each recipient.
  - Replies come back as private 1-on-1 threads.
  - Best for announcements, reminders, updates at scale (up to 100 per send).
- **Group SMS**
  - Creates one shared thread where everyone sees all messages.
  - Best for small, collaborative conversations.
  - **Note:** Group SMS is only supported on 10-digit numbers. Toll-free numbers do not support group texting due to carrier limitations.

#### Write your message

- [**Apply a template**](/messaging/templates-tags) to save time and maintain consistent wording.
- [**Add media (MMS)**](/messaging/media) to include images, PDFs, or other supported files.
- **Insert emoji** for tone and clarity when it makes sense.

## Schedule or Send Now

Choose when your message goes out.

- **Send now** to send your message immediately.
- **Schedule** to send later.
  - Pick from **preset send times** or select **any date/time** from the picker.
  - Scheduled messages show the chosen send time so you can verify before confirming.
  - **Note:** Scheduling is currently one-time only (not recurring). You can create as many scheduled messages as you like in advance and view them all in the [**Scheduled view**](/messaging/scheduled-messages) in your inbox.

<Note>
  **Tip:** Schedule broadcasts during business hours for higher response rates and a better messaging experience.
