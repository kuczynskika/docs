# Compose & Send New Messages in MessageDesk

You can send a quick 1-on-1, a small group text, or a one-to-many broadcast right from the **New message** composer. This guide shows you what each field does, the limits to keep in mind, and a few power-tips so you can move fast.

## At a Glance: What Makes up a New Message

- **Recipients** – who you're sending to
- **Send from** – which connected phone number you're sending from
- **Message** – your text, plus options for template, media, and emoji
- **Send options** – send now or schedule for later

## How to Compose and Send a New Message from MessageDesk

### 1. Click the **New Message** button from the Inbox

![New Message Pn](/docs-main/images/new-message.png)

### 2. Add recipients

Search and add people by **name**, **phone number**, **label**, or **assigned teammate**. As you add them, you'll see each recipient appear as a **chip** beneath the field to confirm they're included.

#### Recipient types

You can send messages to:

- **Individual contacts** – Search by name or phone number to add specific people
- **Labels** – Select a label to send to all conversations with that label attached (up to 100 conversations)
- **Assigned teammates** – Select a teammate to send to all conversations assigned to them (up to 100 conversations)

#### Filter your search

Use the **filter icon** to narrow your search results. You can filter by:

- Conversations (individual contacts)
- Labels
- Assigned teammates

By default, all types appear in search results. You can select any combination of filters to focus your search.

#### Recipient selection rules

- **Only one label or assigned teammate** can be selected per message
  - Once you select a label or assigned teammate, the search box is disabled
  - The message will be sent to the first 100 conversations with that label or assigned to that teammate
- **Once you select an individual contact**, labels and assigned teammates no longer appear in search results
- **Mix individual contacts freely** – Add up to 100 individual contacts by name or phone number

**Pro tips:**

- **Copy/Paste a list of numbers:** You can copy/paste a list of phone numbers directly into the Recipients field. This works great for quick broadcasts.
- **Per-send limit:** You can add **up to 100 recipients** to a single message send. When using labels or assigned teammates, only the first 100 conversations will receive the message.
- **Editing:** Remove anyone by clicking the "x" on their chip before you send.
- **More:** click + more to view all recipient phone numbers

### 3. Select the phone number you want to send from

Choose the [**connected phone number**](/get-started/phone-numbers/overview) you want to send from. You'll see a dropdown of the **active numbers** available in your workspace.

- Pick the number your contacts expect to hear from.
- If you don't see a number, confirm it's connected and active for your workspace.

### 4. Compose your message

This is where you compose and configure what you're sending.

#### Select a message type

- **Send individually**
  - Sends one message to each recipient.
  - Replies come back as private 1-on-1 threads.
  - Best for announcements, reminders, updates at scale (up to 100 per send).
- **Group SMS**
  - Creates one shared thread where everyone sees all messages.
  - Best for small, collaborative conversations.
  - **Note:** Group SMS is only supported on 10-digit numbers. Toll-free numbers do not support group texting due to carrier limitations.

#### Write your message

- **Type your text** as usual.
- [**Apply a template**](/messaging/templates-tags) to save time and maintain consistent wording.
- [**Add media (MMS)**](/messaging/media) to include images, PDFs, or other supported files.
- **Insert emoji** for tone and clarity when it makes sense.

## Post-Send Actions (Broadcasts Only)

When sending a broadcast (Send individually), you can automatically apply actions to all recipient conversations after the message is sent.

![New Message Compose Post Send Actions Pn](/docs-main/images/new-message-compose-post-send-actions.png)

### Available post-send actions

- **Assign a teammate** – Automatically assign all recipient conversations to a specific teammate
- **Apply a label** – Automatically apply a label to all recipient conversations

<Note>
  **Note:** Post-send actions are only available for broadcasts (Send individually). They are disabled for Group SMS messages.
</Note>

**How to use post-send actions:**

1. Compose your broadcast message with recipients.
2. Select **Send individually** as your message type.
3. In the **Post-send actions** section, choose one or both actions:
   - Select a teammate to assign conversations to
   - Select a label to apply to conversations
4. Send or schedule your message.

Post-send actions help you stay organized by automatically routing and categorizing broadcast conversations without manual follow-up.

## Schedule or Send Now

Choose when your message goes out.

- **Send now** to send your message immediately.
- **Schedule** to send later.
  - Pick from **preset send times** or select **any date/time** from the picker.
  - Scheduled messages show the chosen send time so you can verify before confirming.
  - **Note:** Scheduling is currently one-time only (not recurring). You can create as many scheduled messages as you like in advance and view them all in the Scheduled view in your inbox.

<Note>
  **Tip:** Schedule broadcasts during business hours for higher response rates and a better messaging experience.
</Note>
