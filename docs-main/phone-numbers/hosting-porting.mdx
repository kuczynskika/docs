# Hosting

Phone number hosting means moving your existing phone number onto MessageDesk so it can send and receive text messages.

- **Keep Your Number:** You don’t have to change phone numbers. We connect your current number to MessageDesk.
- **Text-Enable Only:** Your calls still work the same—hosting only adds texting capability.
- **Business Benefit:** Customers can text your main number, and your team can manage replies together in MessageDesk.

<Info>
  In short: **hosting = text-enabling your existing business number without interrupting calls.**

# Porting

Phone number porting means **moving your entire phone number** (voice \+ text) from your current carrier to MessageDesk. MessageDesk can forward calls to a different phone number

- **Full Transfer:** Unlike hosting, porting transfers _all_ services—voice and text—into MessageDesk.
- **New Home for Your Number:** MessageDesk becomes your phone service provider for that number.
- **Business Benefit:** Create an SMS-only phone number and forward calls to another phone number to unify all answer-flows.

<Note>
  In short: **porting = moving your number completely to MessageDesk, so all texting and calling run through us.**
