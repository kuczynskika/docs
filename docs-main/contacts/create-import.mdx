## How to add individual contacts

Then, click the + Add contacts button.

### 2. Add First Name, Last Name, and phone number

Once you've added the contact details, click + Create Contact.

<Note>
  First Name and Last Name fields are NOT required when creating a contact. Contacts without a First or Last Name are considered [anonymous contacts in MessageDesk](/contacts/anonymous-opt-out-blocked).
</Note>

<Warning>
  If the number is already assigned to a contact, you'll see an error message. Phone numbers in MessageDesk are considered unique identifiers and may only be tied to one contact, but a contact can have multiple phone numbers.
</Warning>

### 3. View and edit contact details

Once you've saved your contact, you'll see a panel displaying the contact's details. Here you can take several actions, including:

1. Add/associate additional phone numbers with the contact.
2. Copy the contact's phone number to your clipboard.
3. Send a message to the contact from the inbox.
4. Unlink or "delete" the contact's phone number from their contact profile.
5. [Block the contact's phone number](/contacts/anonymous-opt-out-blocked) from sending additional messages to your workspace.

<Warning>
  Changing a contact's phone number may unlink existing conversations with that contact and their profile, as it is saved in MessageDesk.
</Warning>

### 3. Map contact data (columns in your file) to contact properties in MessageDesk

Your fields will auto-map if they have the same name as an existing MessageDesk field.

You can also manually update mapping or include custom properties.
