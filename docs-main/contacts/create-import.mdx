# Add Individual Contacts One-by-One, or Import Many via CSV

You can quickly create a single contact or bring in thousands at once with a CSV—here’s exactly how (and the limits to avoid errors).

---

## Add an Individual Contact

### 1. Go to **Contacts**

Click **\+ Add contacts**.

![Add Contact Individual Pn](/docs-main/images/add-contact-individual.png)

### 2. Enter details

Add **First name**, **Last name**, and **Phone** (email optional), then click **\+ Create Contact**.

<Note>
  First and last name are **not required**. Contacts without names are treated as **anonymous contacts** until you add details later.
</Note>

<Warning>
  If the phone number already belongs to another contact, you’ll see an error. Phone numbers are **unique identifiers** in MessageDesk (one number → one contact). A single contact can have **multiple** numbers.
</Warning>

### 3. View & edit the contact

From the contact panel, you can:

1. Add additional phone numbers.
2. Copy the contact’s number.
3. Send a message from the Inbox.
4. Unlink (“delete”) a number from the profile.
5. Block the contact from messaging your workspace.

<Warning>
  Changing a contact’s primary phone may **unlink** past conversations from the profile.
</Warning>

## Import Contacts in Bulk via CSV

### CSV limits & requirements (read first)

<Note>
  **TL;DR**

  - **Row count:** up to **5,000 rows** per CSV (hard limit)
  - **File size:** up to **10 MB**
  - **Platform:** **Web-only** (imports aren’t supported on mobile/desktop apps)
  - **Format:** must use **.csv** files **with a header row**, **UTF-8** encoding
  - **Required per row:** **Email** _or_ **Phone** (at least one)
</Note>

<Warning>
  **Your CSV must:**

  - Include a **header row** (first line).
  - Use **consistent columns** on every row (same number of columns as the header).
  - Include at least one contact method: **Email** _or_ **Phone** per row.
  - Use **E.164** format for phone numbers (e.g., `+15551234567`).
</Warning>

### 3. Map columns to MessageDesk fields

Fields auto-map when names match. You can adjust mapping and include **custom properties**.

### 4. Fix duplicates & errors (preview step)

MessageDesk validates your data and flags issues **before** import. Invalid rows are **skipped**.

## Validation rules (what we check)

- **Email**: must be a valid email address (`name@example.com`).
- **Phone**: must be **E.164** (e.g., `+15551234567`).
- **Custom properties**: must match defined **types** and constraints.
- **Duplicates**: checked by **email** and **phone** to prevent dupes.

---

## How imports run (under the hood)

- **Batching**: processed in batches up to **5,000** (aligned with the row limit).
- **Async processing**: large uploads are staged and processed server-side for reliability.
- **CSV only**: the importer accepts **.csv**; other formats aren’t supported.

---

## Common Errors & Fixes

- **“CSV file is too large.”**\
  Split your file so each CSV has **≤ 5,000 rows** and **≤ 10 MB**.
- **“CSV imports are only supported on web platform. Please use the web interface for importing contacts.”**\
  Switch to the **web app** to run the import.
- **“Invalid phone format.”**\
  Convert to **E.164** (country code + number, no spaces).
- **“Invalid email address.”**\
  Correct typos or remove invalid emails.
- **“Row has inconsistent number of columns.”**\
  Ensure every row matches the header’s column count.
- **“Missing contact method.”**\
  Add **Email** or **Phone** for that row.

---

## Best practices

- **Normalize phones to E.164** before uploading.
- **Deduplicate** by email/phone first to avoid partial merges.
- **Test with 25 rows** to confirm mapping and validation.
- **Use custom properties** intentionally—ensure data types match your definitions.
- **Keep under limits** (≤ **5,000** rows, ≤ **10 MB**) for smooth importing.

## FAQ

**Can I import from my phone or desktop app?**\
No. CSV imports are **web-only**.

**Can I import other data (conversations, labels, messages, opt-outs)?**\
The import pipeline supports other entities via dedicated tooling. This doc covers **Contacts CSV**.

**What happens to skipped rows?**\
Invalid rows are **skipped**. Fix the CSV and re-import those rows separately.

**Can I update existing contacts?**\
Yes—when an email or phone matches an existing contact, MessageDesk applies your mapping rules and validation to update fields.
