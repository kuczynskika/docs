## Requirements

- **Valid email address**
- **Personal mobile phone number** (for verification; not used as a workspace number)

</Warning>

## 1. Create Your Account

If you're new (and haven't [been invited to an existing workspace](/get-started/join-workspace)), go to the sign-up page and enter your **email** and **password**, or choose **Sign in with Google**.

Yes. MessageDesk supports international phone numbers, but only for account creation, login, and two-factor account verification. MessageDesk does not support sending or receiving messages from international numbers.

**Can I change my workspace name later?**\
Yes. Update it anytime in **Settings → Workspace Profile**.

**I was invited to a workspace—do I still use this page?**\
Follow the **invitation link** you received to join the existing workspace: see [**Join a workspace**](/get-started/join-workspace).
