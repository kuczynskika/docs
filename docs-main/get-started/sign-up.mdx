## How to create a new MessageDesk account and workspace

<Steps>
  <Step title="Visit MessageDesk's sign up page" stepNumber={1}>
    If you're a new MessageDesk user and you haven't already created an account or [received an invitation to an existing MessageDesk workspace](/get-started/join-workspace), you can enter your email and a password to create an account.

    Alternatively, you can sign in with Google to create your MessageDesk account and workspace.

    <Note>
      You must enter a valid email address, including an @ sign.

      You must enter a valid personal MOBILE phone number. Landlines, Skype numbers, Google Voice, and virtual numbers cannot be used for verification.

      This personal phone number is just for personal account creation and user authentication/login purposes. It is not tied to your MessageDesk workspace phone numbers.

      Passwords must contain:

      - At least 1 uppercase character
      - at least 1 number
      - at least 1 symbol
    </Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm sign up" stepNumber={2}>
    After entering your information, you should receive a 6-digit login code sent to your personal mobile phone number.

    Enter the code to proceed.

    <Warning>
      If you do not receive a verification code, contact [support@messagedesk.com](mailto:support@messagedesk.com) or text (775) 313-9465

  <Step title="Verify sign-in with a code from your email" stepNumber={3}>
    After you enter your mobile verification, MessageDesk sends a second verification code to your email address.
