## How MessageDesk Syncs Messages with Your Twilio Numbers

When you connect Twilio numbers to MessageDesk, we automatically configure webhooks to ensure message syncing works seamlessly. Here's what happens:

### Automatic webhook configuration

MessageDesk automatically sets up the necessary webhooks for your Twilio numbers. You don't need to manually configure anything in your Twilio console—just add your credentials and numbers, and we handle the rest.

### Message syncing behavior

**Inbound messages:**
- All inbound SMS and MMS messages are synced to MessageDesk, even if you have other webhook destinations configured in Twilio
- Messages appear in your MessageDesk inbox in real-time

**Outbound messages:**
- Messages sent from MessageDesk are synced automatically
- Messages sent through external systems using your Twilio number are also synced to MessageDesk
- **Note:** Outbound group messages sent by external services will not be synced—only inbound group messages

### Delivery status for external messages

If you send messages through an external system (not MessageDesk) using your Twilio number:
- The message will appear in MessageDesk with a **"Sent"** status
- Delivery status updates (delivered, failed, etc.) will **not** be synced from external sends
- If you need delivery status tracking, send messages directly from MessageDesk

<Note>
  **For existing Twilio users:** If you added your Twilio numbers to MessageDesk before this update, your numbers are still using the previous webhook pattern and will continue to work normally. If you need to migrate to the new event-based system, contact [support@messagedesk.com](mailto:support@messagedesk.com) for assistance.
