## How MessageDesk Syncs Messages with Your Twilio Numbers

When you connect Twilio numbers to MessageDesk, we use Twilio's Event Streams to sync messages without affecting your existing Twilio setup. This means you can continue using your current workflows, webhooks, and integrations exactly as before.

![Twilio Events Pn](/docs-main/images/twilio-events.png)

### Event Streams integration

MessageDesk leverages Twilio's Event Streams to listen for message events. This approach:

- **Doesn't interfere with your existing setup** - Your current webhooks, integrations, and workflows remain unchanged
- **Works alongside other systems** - You can use MessageDesk while maintaining other Twilio integrations
- **Syncs all message activity** - Both inbound and outbound messages are captured natively

You don't need to configure anything manually—add your Twilio credentials and numbers, and we handle the Event Streams setup automatically.

### Message syncing behavior

**Inbound messages:**

- All inbound SMS and MMS messages are synced to MessageDesk in real-time
- Your existing Twilio webhooks and integrations continue to receive messages as normal

**Outbound messages:**

- Messages sent from MessageDesk are synced automatically
- Messages sent through external systems (like your API or other platforms) using your Twilio number are also synced to MessageDesk
- This is especially powerful for broadcast users who want to send high-volume messages via API while maintaining visibility in MessageDesk

### Delivery status tracking

**Messages sent from MessageDesk:**

- Full delivery status tracking (sent, delivered, failed, etc.)

**Messages sent from external systems:**

- Messages appear in MessageDesk with a **"Sent"** status
- Delivery status updates from external sends are not currently synced
- For complete delivery tracking, send messages directly from MessageDesk

<Note>
  **For existing Twilio users:** If you added your Twilio numbers to MessageDesk before this update, your numbers are still using the previous webhook pattern and will continue to work normally. If you need to migrate to the new event-based system, contact [support@messagedesk.com](mailto:support@messagedesk.com) for assistance.

## Troubleshooting

### Default webhook URL causing issues

When you add a new number in Twilio, it automatically configures a default webhook URL. If you're experiencing issues sending messages from MessageDesk, this default configuration may be the cause.

**To resolve this:**

1. Log in to your [Twilio Console](https://console.twilio.com/)
2. Navigate to your phone number's configuration
3. Clear the webhook URL field (leave it blank)
4. Save your changes

This is safe to do because MessageDesk uses [Event Streams](https://www.twilio.com/docs/events)—not webhooks—to sync messages. Clearing the default webhook URL won't affect MessageDesk functionality.

### Using multiple services with your Twilio number

Since MessageDesk uses Event Streams, your Twilio number can work with multiple services simultaneously. If you need other applications to receive message webhooks:

- **Event Streams subscriptions** - Add multiple subscribers to receive message events. See [Twilio Event Streams documentation](https://www.twilio.com/docs/events).
- **TwiML functions** - Route webhooks to multiple endpoints. See [TwiML for Programmable Messaging](https://www.twilio.com/docs/messaging/twiml).
- **Messaging webhooks** - Configure webhooks for other services as needed. See [Twilio Messaging Webhooks](https://www.twilio.com/docs/usage/webhooks/messaging-webhooks).

MessageDesk won't interfere with any of these configurations.
