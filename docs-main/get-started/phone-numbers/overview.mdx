# Learn How to Connect New or Existing Phone Numbers to MessageDesk

Setting up texting is a single, streamlined flow that combines [**carrier registration**](/carrier-registration/overview) with **phone configuration**. You choose the number path (purchase, host, or connect), we guide you through the right steps, and you start texting.

---

## Your Onboarding Journey

1. Complete the [Carrier Registration Questionnaire](/carrier-registration/submit)

**2. Provide business information (if needed)** If you haven't registered yet, you'll add basic business details so we can complete **A2P 10DLC** (for local numbers) or **Toll-Free Verification**.

**3. Choose your configuration path**

- **Purchase new**: Local **10DLC** or **toll-free** numbers
- **Connect existing**: **Landline**, **VoIP**, local 10DLC, or **toll-free** numbers
- **Connect Twilio**: Plug in your Twilio numbers (see note below)

**4. Start texting**: Once approved and connected, you're ready to message from your shared inbox.

<Note>
  **Twilio users:** You manage registration directly with Twilio. When you connect those numbers to MessageDesk, you generally don't need to register again—just connect and go. MessageDesk automatically configures webhooks for your Twilio numbers to ensure seamless message syncing.
</Note>

## Important to Know

- **Registration is part of setup**: It's not a separate first step—our flow handles it.
- **Smart routing in the form**: The configuration form adapts to your choices (purchase vs. connect, local vs. toll-free, etc.).
- **Different paths for different stacks**: Twilio-connected numbers keep using your Twilio registration state.

- **Google Voice** and **mobile carrier personal numbers** (unless fully **ported** to a VoIP provider first)
- **Virtual numbers** (non-carrier virtual SMS apps/services)
- **Short codes (outbound)** – MessageDesk doesn't send from 5–6 digit codes
  - Inbound from short codes is supported (you can receive replies)

<Note>
  **Note:** To use a personal mobile or Google Voice number, first **port** it to a VoIP provider, then connect it for texting with MessageDesk.
</Note>

## Hosting vs. Porting (What's the Difference?)

### Phone number hosting (text-enable only)

We add **SMS** to your existing number—**voice stays with your current provider**.

- Keep your current number
- Calls continue to route exactly as they do now
- Texts flow through MessageDesk into your shared inbox

<Warning>
  **Important:** Once we host your number for texting, any text messages currently being received in your VoIP system will no longer appear there. All text messages will only be received in MessageDesk. Voice calls remain unaffected and continue to work in your current system.
</Warning>

<Note>
  **Note:** Hosting works for traditional landlines, local 10-digit numbers, and most VoIP-connected numbers.
</Note>

### Phone number porting (move everything)

We **move the entire number** (voice + text) to MessageDesk.

- Full transfer of services
- MessageDesk becomes the provider for that number

<Note>
  **Note:** In short: **Hosting = add texting** to your current setup. **Porting = move voice + text** to MessageDesk.
</Note>

## Texting with Multiple Numbers

You can connect **up to 48 phone lines** to a single workspace and manage all conversations in one place. Filter your inbox by **phone line**, and tailor **roles & permissions** so only the right teammates see the right conversations.

## Registration & Deliverability Essentials

- **A2P 10DLC (local)**: Required for most U.S. local business texting; improves throughput and reduces filtering.
- **Toll-Free Verification**: Recommended/required for higher volume and better deliverability on toll-free.
- **Twilio**: Registration stays in Twilio; just connect your numbers to MessageDesk.
- **Timing**: Registration can take time to approve—plan ahead for campaigns.
- **Content**: Avoid generic short links and spammy phrasing; include opt-out language when appropriate.

## Frequently Asked Phone Number Questions

### How many phone numbers can I connect?

Up to **48** phone numbers per workspace.

### How soon can I start texting?

- **Outbound**: After your number is connected **and** registration (10DLC or toll-free) is approved.
- **Inbound**: As soon as the number is connected, inbound texts will appear in your inbox.

### Does every teammate see every conversation?

No. Use **roles & permissions** to limit access by **phone line**, **label**, or **teammate inbox**.

### Can I rename lines for clarity?

Yes. Go to **Settings → Phone Management** to name a line (you can even add an emoji), which helps triage in the Inbox.

### Can international users access MessageDesk with US or Canadian numbers?

Yes, international users can use MessageDesk with US or Canadian numbers if they are tied to a North American business entity and can complete carrier registration for that entity. For example, a US-based business with support representatives in other countries can use MessageDesk.

### Can I send or receive texts internationally with a US or Canadian number?

No. MessageDesk only supports sending and receiving text messages to and from phone numbers in North America (US and Canada). Even if you have a US-registered number, you cannot text phone numbers outside of North America.

### What if my provider isn't listed?

If it's a standard **landline** or **VoIP** number in the U.S./Canada, we can likely text-enable it. Use the configuration form, and we'll route you down the right path.

### Can I use phone line extension numbers with MessageDesk?

MessageDesk does not directly integrate with or support texting for phone line extension numbers. However, you can configure **user Roles and Permissions** in MessageDesk to limit access to certain phone lines. Additionally, you can use **conversation assignment** and **Relays** to automate who gets assigned to what conversation on any given phone line.
