## Getting started with MessageDesk

Setting up your phone numbers with MessageDesk is a streamlined process that combines carrier registration with phone configuration. Here's what to expect:

### Your onboarding journey

1. **Complete the phone configuration form** - You'll fill out [this typeform](https://messagedesk.typeform.com/to/bBBLwZXX) to configure your phone lines
2. **Provide business information (if needed)** - If you haven't completed carrier registration yet, you'll provide your business details as part of the form
3. **Choose your phone configuration** - Select how you want to set up your numbers:
   - **Purchase new:** Local 10DLC or toll-free numbers
   - **Connect existing:** Landline, VoIP, local 10DLC, or toll-free numbers
   - **Connect Twilio:** If you're a Twilio user (see note below)
4. **Start texting** - Once setup is complete, you can begin messaging

<Note>
  **Twilio users:** If you're connecting Twilio numbers, you manage carrier registration on your own through Twilio before connecting to MessageDesk. By the time you reach us, you just need to connect your numbers to our inbox—no additional registration required.
</Note>

### Important to know

- **Registration happens during phone setup** - Carrier registration isn't a separate first step. It's built into the phone configuration process, so you complete everything in one flow.
- **The typeform handles everything** - Our configuration form uses smart logic to route you through the right steps based on your needs.
- **Different paths for different users** - Twilio users skip MessageDesk registration entirely since they manage it through Twilio.

## Unsupported Phone Number Types

Below is a list of unsupported phone number types.

<Note>
  MessageDesk does not support international numbers outside the US/Canada.
</Note>

### 1. Google Voice and mobile numbers tied to mobile carriers (personal numbers)

Mobile networks are notoriously difficult to work with. They're reluctant to release phone numbers on their networks to other providers (even just for text messaging purposes).

To use your mobile number or a Google Voice number with MessageDesk, you'll first need to port your number to a new VoIP provider.

This effectively moves all calling and texting associated with that phone number.

Once you complete this port, you can then host your number with MessageDesk just for texting.

<Note>
  See below for additional details on phone number hosting vs. phone number porting
</Note>

### 2. Virtual Numbers

MessageDesk does not support integration with virtual numbers like

### 3. Short-code phone numbers (Outbound Only)

MessageDesk does not support sending messages from 5-6 digit short-code phone numbers like 666666 or 55-4444.

<Note>
  MessageDesk does support RECEIVING text messages from short-code phone numbers.
</Note>

### 4. WhatsApp (coming soon!)

In the near future, MessageDesk will support text messaging with WhatsApp-connected phone numbers.

## Phone Number Hosting vs. Phone Number Porting

### What is phone number hosting?

When we say you'll be hosting your phone number with MessageDesk, we mean that we'll only host the SMS text messaging capabilities associated with your number.

Phone number hosting does not disrupt or change the existing voice/telephony features or configuration associated with your phone number.

Phone number hosting or "text-enabling" your numbers means:

- **You Keep Your Number:** You don’t have to change phone numbers. We connect your current number to MessageDesk for text messaging purposes.
- **Text-Enable Only:** Your calls still work the same—hosting only adds texting capability.
- **Business Benefit:** Customers can text your existing number, and your team can manage replies together in MessageDesk.

<Note>
  Phone number hosting is possible for all traditional landlines, local 10-digit phone numbers, and any phone number/line connected to a VoIP provider. In each case, your existing voice provider stays the same - you're only adding/routing texts through MessageDesk.
</Note>

### What is phone number porting?

Phone number porting means **moving your entire phone number** (voice + text) from your current carrier or provider to MessageDesk.

- **Full Transfer:** Unlike hosting, porting transfers _all_ services—voice and text—to MessageDesk.
- **New Home for Your Number:** MessageDesk becomes your phone service provider for that number.

<Note>
  In short: **porting = moving your number completely to MessageDesk, so all texting and calling runs through us.**
</Note>

## Texting with Multiple Phone Numbers

MessageDesk enables you to add up to 48 phone numbers to your inbox and manage all conversations across those phone lines in one place.

You can also organize your conversations by phone number to see everything at a glance or drill down to a specific set of conversations.

You can also assign or revoke phone number access for teams and individual teammates. This makes it easy to customize which teammates have access to which conversations.
