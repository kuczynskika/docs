## Processing time

After you submit your Letter of Authorization (LOA), our team processes the hosting request on the backend. Processing time varies by provider:

- **Typical timeline:** 5 minutes to 72 hours

<Note>
  **Adding additional numbers later?** You'll need to complete a new LOA for each number you want to add. The same processing timeline applies.
</Note>

## Supported VoIP Providers

Below is a list of all supported VoIP providers. You can text-enable and transfer phone numbers from any of these providers to MessageDesk via [phone number hosting](https://docs.messagedesk.com/get-started/phone-numbers/overview#hosting-vs-porting-what%E2%80%99s-the-difference).

In this case, all of your calling, voice features, and service will remain with your VoIP provider. The text messaging associated with the number will move to MessageDesk. Many businesses and organizations configure their numbers in this way to get the best of both voice and text messaging features.

Don't see your provider? If your number is non-mobile and not tied to a mobile device, in most cases, you can still transfer it to MessageDesk and text-enable it.
