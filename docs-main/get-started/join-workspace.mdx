### Overview

Received an invite to join your team’s MessageDesk workspace? Here’s how to accept it and create your own MessageDesk user account.

## How to accept your MessageDesk invitation

A workspace admin or manager will send you an invitation to MessageDesk via email.

An email invitation to MessageDesk looks like this:

Click Join the Team to accept your invitation and to join your team's workspace.

## Account creation options as an invited MessageDesk user

You have two options for creating your account:

1. **Sign in with email**: You’ll receive a one-time 6-digit code in your email inbox
2. **Sign in with Google**: No passwords or codes needed - just sign in and you’re all set

<Warning>
  Sign up with the exact same email address that received the invitation (most likely your work or organization email). For example, if your original invitation came to [**marty@pigeon.com**](mailto:marty@pigeon.com), make sure to sign up as [**marty@pigeon.com**](mailto:marty@pigeon.com). Otherwise, you’ll create your own separate workspace.
</Warning>

Visit this doc for additional instructions on [creating a brand new MessageDesk account](/get-started/sign-up).

Once you complete creating your account, you'll automatically land in your team's inbox/workspace.

## Join multiple MessageDesk workspaces via email invitation

MessageDesk makes it possible to join/work in multiple workspaces/inboxes.

If you've already created a MessageDesk account, you'll recieve the same workspace invitation email, but instead of creating an account, you'll be directed to a list of workspaces that you've been invited to.
