# Join an Existing MessageDesk Workspace

Got an invite from your team? Here’s how to accept it, create your user account, and jump into the shared inbox.

---

## Accept Your MessageDesk Invitation

You’ll receive an email from MessageDesk with a **Join the Team** button.

![Join Messagedesk Email Pn](/docs-main/images/join-messagedesk-email.png)

Click **Join the Team** to open the sign-in page and complete your account.

<Warning>
  **Warning:** Be sure to log in/create an account using the **exact same email address** that you were invited with (usually your work email). If you sign up with a different email, you’ll create a **separate workspace**.
</Warning>

---

## Create Your User Account (As an Invited User)

You have two ways to finish the setup:

1. **Sign in with email** – we’ll send a **one-time 6-digit code** to your email; enter it to continue.
2. **Sign in with Google** – no codes required; approve with your Google account.

After you complete account creation, you’ll land directly in your team’s workspace.

<Tip>
  **Tip:** Need to create a new workspace instead? See [**Sign up for MessageDesk**](/get-started/sign-up).

## Join Multiple Workspaces

You can be a member of **multiple** MessageDesk workspaces. If you already have a MessageDesk account:

- Clicking a new invite opens a list of workspaces you’ve been invited to.
- Choose the workspace you want to join.

Switching between workspaces is quick—open the workspace switcher (top-left or profile menu, depending on app view) and select the workspace you need.

---

## What Happens Next

- Your access is based on **roles & permissions** set by your admin (Admin, Manager, Operator, or a custom role).
- You’ll see the **Inbox**, can view or send messages according to your permissions, and (optionally) receive notifications once configured.
- If you don’t see expected phone lines or labels, your role may limit access—ask an admin to adjust.

---

## Troubleshooting

**Didn’t receive the invite email?**

- Check **spam/junk** and any **security/quarantine** filters.
- Confirm with your admin that the **email address** is correct.
- Ask IT to allowlist `messagedesk.com`, then have the admin **resend** the invite.

**Invite link expired or not working?**

- Ask your admin to **Resend Invitation** from **Settings → Team Management**.
- Try opening the link in an **incognito/private** browser window.

**Signed in with the wrong email by accident?**

- Log out, then sign in again using the **exact invited email**.
- If you created a new workspace by mistake, your admin can re-send the invite to the correct address.

**I joined but don’t see Team Management or certain phone lines.**

- Your role may be **Viewer** on those features/lines. Ask an admin to review your **role** and any **resource-level** permissions.
