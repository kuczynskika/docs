## Accepting an Invitation

When a teammate is invited, they'll receive an email from MessageDesk. This email will route them to `inbox.messagedesk.com/#/create-account`

To accept their invitation, they just need to create an account with the same email address they were invited with.

Upon account creation, they'll be automatically added to any inboxes they've been invited to.
