## Why MessageDesk

We believe great conversations build great businesses.

Unfortunately, most business texting tools feel impersonal—built for blasts, not real connections.

MessageDesk makes it easy for your team and your customers to connect over text through a delightfully easy Team Inbox.

1. **Texting shouldn't feel like a workaround**. It should feel **rich, personal, and powerful**—and it should work for your whole team.
2. **Everyone needs visibility**. Everyone should be able to jump in, assign conversations, and keep things moving. That’s why MessageDesk makes it easy to route, assign, and manage every message in one shared inbox.
3. **Business communication is changing fast**. We’re here to help companies of all sizes meet people where they are—with tools that are simple, reliable, and built for the way teams really work.

## How Does MessageDesk Work?

MessageDesk is a shared inbox platform designed for managing SMS conversations at scale. It helps businesses and teams centralize text message communication with their contacts, making it easy to collaborate, organize, and respond as a team.

MessageDesk makes it easy to unify your existing phone numbers into a single SMS inbox. This is great for businesses with hardline phones (landlines), VoIP systems or Twilio phone numbers.

**Key Features**

\* **Shared Inbox:** Multiple teammates can see, assign, and reply to messages from a single, unified space.

\* **Custom Teammate Permissions**: Customize what conversations each teammate has access to by assigning access by phone number, inbox label, or teammate inbox.

\* **Automations & Scheduling:** Set up recurring reminders, auto-replies, and scheduled messages.

\* **Compliance Tools:** Handle SMS-specific regulations like 10DLC registration.
