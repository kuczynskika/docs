# Welcome to MessageDesk

## Why MessageDesk

Great conversations build great businesses. Most texting tools were built for blasts—not for real, back-and-forth dialogue. MessageDesk gives your whole team a **shared SMS inbox** that feels **rich, personal, and powerful**.

- **Team visibility:** Anyone can jump in, assign, and resolve conversations—without juggling personal phones.
- **One place for everything:** Route, label, and manage every message from every connected phone line.
- **Built for now:** Simple, reliable tools that help you meet people where they are—by text.

## How MessageDesk Works

MessageDesk centralizes SMS across your business phone numbers (landline/VoIP hosting, purchased local/toll-free, or connected Twilio) into a single, collaborative inbox.

**Key features**

- **Shared Inbox:** Teammates see the same thread, assign owners, leave internal comments, and reply fast.
- **Custom roles and permissions:** Control access by **phone line**, **label**, or **teammate inbox** (roles & resource-level permissions).
- **Automations and scheduling:** Set **auto-replies** (e.g., after-hours) and **schedule** messages for later.
- **Compliance tools:** Support for **opt-in and opt-out** and **carrier registration** to improve deliverability.
