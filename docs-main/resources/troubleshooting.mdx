# Troubleshooting SMS Delivery

Short, direct fixes to keep your texts reaching customers.

## Quick triage (60 seconds)

- **Check status:** In MessageDesk, look at the message status badge. If it’s `Failed`, click to open the error details.
- **Retry smartly:** Send a short plain-text follow-up without links or images.
- **Try another route:** If urgent, call or email while you troubleshoot.

## Message Status & Troubleshoot Guide

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Delivered" description="but customer says “I didn’t get it”" icon="check">
    Silent failures happen when carriers identify potenial SPAM or Misleading content.

    We suggest retrying the message but make sure to:

    - Remove links/shorteners, cut marketing language, send a short, transactional message.
    - Include your business name and opt-out line. Then retry.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Queued" description="Message has not been sent yet" icon="clock">
    MessageDesk queues messages in a "line" for each inbox. If your using the inbox alongside many teammates at once, it's possible your messages stay in the queue for extended periods of time

    - **Why do we queue messages?** It improves overall deliverability since the carrier network can only process a certain number of text messages per second for each phone number.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Failed" description=" Message was sent but did not get delivered" icon="exclamation" iconType="regular">
    A failed message means the carrier network returned an error to MessageDesk and notified us that the message was **not delivered** to the recipient.

    **Troubleshoot failed message:**

    1. Retry sending a simple message to the recipient. Sometimes messages with large media attachments, long paragraphs of text or links fail to get delivered.
    2. Send a message to a different recipient to confirm messaging works

    [******If step 1 or 2 fail to deliver, take a screenshot of both messages & conversations andemail them to \*\* support@messagedesk.com******](mailto:support@messagedesk.com) \*\*for further assistance

    - Include Recipient phone numbers
    - Include date/time of message sends
    - Include message content (copy the failed message)
    - Include which phone number you sent the message from
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Sent" description="Message was sent to carriers" icon="reply" iconType="regular">
    A sent message may be delivered. MessageDesk will maintain a `Sent` status until one of 2 things happen:

    1. Carrier network returns a `Failed` status. When this happens MessageDesk will update message status from `sent` -\> `failed`
    2. Carrier network returns a `Delivered` status. When this happens, MessageDesk will update the message status from `sent` -\> `delivered`

    <Info>
      **\_NOTE: \_**Carriers do not always return a status. This can happen when the recipient is traveling or moving between multiple cell towers. When a status is not returned, MessageDesk maintains a `Sent` status.

## Common Messaging Scenarios

- **Failed — Destination number unknown/no longer exists:**
  - Verify the number, check for typos, confirm it’s still active.
  - Ask the contact for an updated number if issues persist.
- **Failed — Destination handset unavailable:**
  - Phone is off, out of coverage, or network is congested.
  - Wait a few minutes and retry, or call if urgent.
- **Failed — Destination blocked from receiving message:**
  - Recipient may have blocked you or carrier filtered.
  - Ask recipient to unblock/whitelist your number. Call if needed.
- **Failed — Unable to receive message — Landline or unreachable:**
  - You’re texting a landline or non‑SMS number.
  - Call the number or get a mobile-enabled number from the contact.
- **Failed — Content flagged/violates carrier guidelines:**
  - Remove spammy words, avoid ALL CAPS/excess punctuation.
  - Don’t use URL shorteners. Clearly identify your business and include opt‑out.
  - Ensure your A2P 10DLC or Toll‑Free registration is approved and accurate.
- **Not receiving messages from specific senders or short codes:**
  - Many services block virtual numbers for verification. Short codes (5–6 digits) may not work.
  - Use a personal mobile for initial account verification, or ask the sender for a 10‑digit alternative.

## After porting or hosting your number

- **0–24 hours:** SMS/MMS may be inconsistent while carriers update routes.
- **24–48 hours:** Most issues resolve.
- **48\+ hours:** Collect examples and contact support.
- 

<Info>
  **Tip:** Test with 2–3 contacts across different carriers (e.g., Verizon, AT&T, T‑Mobile) and capture timestamps and screenshots.
</Info>

## Content & compliance checklist (deliverability boosters)

- **Identify yourself:** “Hi [Name], it’s [Business]…”
- **Get consent, honor opt-out:** Include “Reply STOP to opt out.”
- **Keep it short:** One clear purpose per message.
- **No link shorteners:** Use full, reputable URLs.
- **Avoid spam triggers:** “FREE,” “WINNER,” excessive punctuation, ALL CAPS.

## MMS & media tips

- **Use small files:** Keep images under ~1 MB; compress before sending.
- **Prefer static images:** Videos are more likely to fail or compress poorly.
- **If it fails repeatedly:** Share a link to a file (Drive/Dropbox) instead of an attachment.

## What to send MessageDesk Support for faster fixes

- **Three\+ failed examples** with dates/times and recipient phone numbers.
- **Exact error details** from MessageDesk (screenshots help).
- **Recipient carriers** if known.
- **Your recent message content** (copy/paste), including any links.
