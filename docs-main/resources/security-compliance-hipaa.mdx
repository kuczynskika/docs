# Data Security, Compliance & HIPAA

We protect your data and help you use SMS responsibly. This page explains **what you can send**, **what to avoid**, and how to access our **security documentation**.

- **HIPAA:** You **may not** send PHI by text via MessageDesk. MessageDesk **cannot sign BAAs** at this time.
- **SOC 2:** Audit **in progress**; targeted completion **January 2026**.

## HIPAA & Texting: What's Allowed (And What Isn't)

SMS is a carrier-routed channel and cannot be made fully end-to-end encrypted. That means **don't send PHI** (Protected Health Information) over SMS.

### What you **can** send (non-PHI)

- Appointment reminders **without** health details
- General practice information (address, parking, directions)
- Office hours and contact information
- Non-specific follow-ups ("Thanks for visiting—complete your post-visit survey")

### What you **should not** send (PHI)

- Diagnoses or symptoms
- Treatment or care plan details
- Prescriptions or medication names/dosages
- Lab or test results
- Any other **patient-identifying health information**

<Warning>
  **No BAA:** MessageDesk is **not currently in a legal position to sign BAAs**. If your organization requires a BAA, MessageDesk may not be the right fit for PHI-related workflows today.
</Warning>

### Best practices for healthcare teams

1. **Train your staff** on PHI restrictions and when to switch channels.
2. [**Use templates**](/messaging/templates-tags) that exclude PHI and include clear, neutral language.
3. **Keep reminders generic** (date/time/location only).
4. **Redirect PHI** to secure portals, phone calls, or in-network tools.
5. **Document your policy** for when SMS is appropriate vs. not.
6. Reference our [**Privacy Policy**](https://www.messagedesk.com/privacy-policy) for how we handle personal information.
