## Is MessageDesk HIPAA Compliant?

Text messaging is a fundamentally unsecure channel. Text messages are stored on servers at the carrier network level, making it impossible to have true end-to-end encryption at all stages of a message's journey.

However, healthcare providers can use SMS to communicate with patients as long as they **do not share any PHI (Personal Health Information)** via text.

### What you can send

- Appointment reminders without health details
- General practice information
- Office hours and contact information
- Non-specific follow-up messages

### What you should not send

- Diagnosis information
- Treatment details
- Prescription information
- Test results
- Any other PHI

### Business Associate Agreements (BAA)

MessageDesk is not currently in a legal position to sign Business Associate Agreements (BAAs). If your clinic or practice requires a signed BAA for vendor relationships, MessageDesk may not be the right solution at this time.

### Best practices for healthcare providers

If you're a healthcare provider using MessageDesk:

1. Train your team on PHI restrictions
2. Create message templates that avoid sending PHI in messages
3. Use generic language for appointment reminders
4. Never include patient health details in messages
5. Consider alternative secure channels for PHI communication
