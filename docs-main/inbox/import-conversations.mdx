# Import Conversations in Bulk via CSV

You can import closed conversations into MessageDesk using a CSV file or Google Sheets link. This is useful for migrating historical conversations from other platforms or bulk-creating conversation records.

<Note>
  **TL;DR**

  - **Format:** CSV with exactly **3 columns** (Labels, Inbound address, Outbound address)
  - **Phone format:** **E.164** required (e.g., `+15551234567`)
  - **Status:** All imported conversations are set to **Closed**
  - **Labels:** Automatically created if they don't exist
  - **Source:** Google Sheets link or any HTTP-accessible CSV file
  - **No row limit:** Unlike contact imports (5,000 row limit), conversation imports have no explicit row limit, but very large files may cause memory issues
</Note>

## CSV File Format Requirements

### Column structure

Your CSV must have **exactly 3 columns** in this order:

| Column | Field | Description | Required |
|--------|-------|-------------|----------|
| 0 | Labels | Comma-separated labels (e.g., `Support,Urgent`) | No |
| 1 | Inbound address | Customer phone number in E.164 format | Yes |
| 2 | Outbound address | Your workspace phone number in E.164 format | Yes |

<Warning>
  **Your CSV must:**

  - Include a **header row** (first row is skipped; headers are not validated)
  - Have **exactly 3 columns** on every row (including the header)
  - Use **E.164 format** for all phone numbers (e.g., `+15551234567`)
  - Reference an **outbound address** that already exists as an outbound channel in your workspace
</Warning>

### Example CSV format

```csv
Labels,Inbound Address,Outbound Address
Support,+15551234567,+15559876543
Sales,Urgent,+15552223333,+15559876543
,+15554445555,+15559876543
```

In this example:
- Row 1: Conversation with one label (`Support`)
- Row 2: Conversation with two labels (`Sales`, `Urgent`)
- Row 3: Conversation with no labels

---

## Phone Number Requirements

### E.164 format

All phone numbers must use **E.164 format**:
- Start with `+` (plus sign)
- Include country code
- No spaces, dashes, or parentheses
- Example: `+15551234567` (not `(555) 123-4567` or `555-123-4567`)

### Outbound address (your workspace phone)

- Must **already exist** as an outbound channel in your workspace
- If the outbound address doesn't exist, that row will fail during import
- The system will **not** create new outbound channels automatically

### Inbound address (customer phone)

- The system will **find or create** the inbound channel automatically
- If the phone number doesn't exist as a contact, it will be created as an anonymous contact

---

## Label Handling

### Multiple labels per conversation

Add multiple labels by separating them with commas in column 0:

```csv
Labels,Inbound Address,Outbound Address
Support,Urgent,Priority,+15551234567,+15559876543
```

This creates a conversation with three labels: `Support`, `Urgent`, and `Priority`.

### Automatic label creation

- Labels are **created automatically** if they don't exist in your workspace
- No need to pre-create labels before importing
- Labels will use default colors and icons

### Empty labels

If column 0 is empty, the conversation is still created but without any labels:

```csv
Labels,Inbound Address,Outbound Address
,+15551234567,+15559876543
```

---

## File Source Requirements

### Supported sources

- **Google Sheets link:** Provide a Google Sheets URL (automatically converted to CSV export format)
- **Direct CSV file:** Any CSV file accessible via HTTP GET request
- **File must be downloadable** from the provided link

### Google Sheets setup

1. Create your spreadsheet with the required 3-column format
2. Set sharing to **"Anyone with the link can view"**
3. Copy the Google Sheets URL (e.g., `https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/...`)
4. Provide the link during import (MessageDesk automatically converts it to `/export?format=csv`)

<Tip>
  **Tip:** Google Sheets is the recommended method for large imports because you can easily edit, validate, and share the data before importing.
</Tip>

## Import Behavior

### Conversation status

- **All imported conversations are set to Closed status**
- Conversations will **not** appear in your Open Inbox
- They will appear in your **Closed Inbox** and conversation history
- If a customer replies to an imported conversation, it will reopen automatically

### Processing

- **Async processing:** Imports run in the background
- **Batch processing:** Rows are processed in batches for reliability
- **No real-time updates:** AppSync is disabled during import to prevent UI performance issues
- **Continues on error:** If a row fails (e.g., invalid phone, missing outbound channel), the import continues processing other rows

### What gets created

For each valid row:
1. **Inbound channel** (customer phone) is found or created
2. **Outbound channel** (your workspace phone) must already exist
3. **Conversation** is created between the two channels
4. **Labels** are applied (created if they don't exist)
5. **Status** is set to Closed

---

## Row Validation & Error Handling

### What causes a row to fail

- **Wrong column count:** Row has more or fewer than 3 columns
- **Invalid phone format:** Phone numbers not in E.164 format
- **Missing outbound channel:** The outbound address doesn't exist in your workspace
- **Empty required fields:** Missing inbound or outbound address

### How errors are handled

- **Individual row failures:** If a row fails, the import continues processing other rows
- **No detailed error report:** The function returns successfully created conversations, but individual row failures are not detailed in the return value
- **Empty rows:** May be processed but will likely fail validation

<Warning>
  **Important:** Because individual row failures are not reported in detail, it's critical to validate your CSV format before importing. Test with a small sample first.
</Warning>

---

## File Size & Row Limits

### No explicit row limit

- Unlike contact imports (5,000 row limit), conversation imports have **no explicit row count limit**
- However, the entire file is loaded into memory, so **very large files may cause memory issues**

### Recommended limits

- **Test with small batches first** (10–50 rows) to validate format
- **For large imports** (1,000+ rows), consider splitting into multiple files
- **Monitor import progress** and check for failures before importing additional batches

---

## Step-by-Step Import Process

### 1. Prepare your CSV

1. Create a CSV with exactly 3 columns: Labels, Inbound Address, Outbound Address
2. Add a header row (content doesn't matter; it will be skipped)
3. Format all phone numbers in E.164 format
4. Verify your outbound addresses exist in your workspace

### 2. Validate your data

- **Check column count:** Every row must have exactly 3 columns
- **Verify phone format:** All numbers must start with `+` and include country code
- **Confirm outbound channels:** Log in to MessageDesk and verify your workspace phone numbers
- **Test with a small sample:** Import 5–10 rows first to catch formatting issues

### 3. Upload or link your file

- **Google Sheets:** Share the sheet publicly and provide the URL
- **Direct CSV:** Ensure the file is accessible via HTTP GET request

### 4. Monitor the import

- Imports run in the background
- Check your **Closed Inbox** to verify imported conversations appear
- Look for conversations with the labels you specified

## Common Errors & Fixes

### "Row has wrong number of columns"

**Cause:** Row has more or fewer than 3 columns.

**Fix:** Ensure every row (including empty label rows) has exactly 3 columns:
```csv
Labels,Inbound Address,Outbound Address
,+15551234567,+15559876543
```

### "Invalid phone format"

**Cause:** Phone number is not in E.164 format.

**Fix:** Convert all phone numbers to E.164:
- ✅ Correct: `+15551234567`
- ❌ Wrong: `(555) 123-4567`, `555-123-4567`, `5551234567`

### "Outbound channel not found"

**Cause:** The outbound address (column 2) doesn't exist in your workspace.

**Fix:** 
1. Go to **Settings → Workspace → Phone Management**
2. Verify the phone number exists and is active
3. If missing, connect the phone number first, then retry the import

### "File not accessible"

**Cause:** The CSV file or Google Sheets link is not publicly accessible.

**Fix:**
- **Google Sheets:** Set sharing to "Anyone with the link can view"
- **Direct CSV:** Ensure the file URL is accessible via HTTP GET without authentication

---

## Best Practices

- **Normalize phone numbers to E.164** before uploading (use a spreadsheet formula or script)
- **Test with 5–10 rows** to validate format and catch errors early
- **Use Google Sheets** for easy editing, validation, and sharing
- **Pre-create important labels** with specific colors/icons (or let the import create them with defaults)
- **Verify outbound channels exist** in your workspace before importing
- **Split large imports** into batches of 500–1,000 rows for easier troubleshooting
- **Document your import** (save the source CSV and note the import date/time)

## FAQ

### Can I import open conversations?

No. All imported conversations are set to **Closed** status. If a customer replies, the conversation will reopen automatically.

### Can I import messages or conversation history?

No. This import creates **conversation records only** (no message content). To import historical messages, use the [**Data Center**](/settings/data-center) message import feature.

### What happens if the inbound phone number already has a conversation?

A new conversation record is created. MessageDesk allows multiple conversations with the same contact.

### Can I update existing conversations?

No. This import only **creates new conversations**. It does not update or modify existing conversation records.

### Can I import from mobile or desktop apps?

The import feature availability depends on your workspace configuration. Check with your workspace admin or use the **web app** for the most reliable import experience.

### How do I know which rows failed?

Individual row failures are not reported in detail. To identify failures:
1. Count the conversations in your Closed Inbox after import
2. Compare to the number of rows in your CSV (minus header)
3. Re-import any missing conversations after fixing format issues

### Can I import conversations for multiple outbound channels at once?

Yes. Include different outbound addresses in column 2 for different rows. Each row can reference a different workspace phone number (as long as all exist in your workspace).
