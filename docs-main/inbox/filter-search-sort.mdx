# Search, Sort & Filter Conversations in Your Inbox

## Quick Sorting

Use the **Sort** menu to change the order of your conversation list:

- **Newest** – most recent activity at the top
- **Oldest** – oldest activity at the top (great for closing out stragglers)
- **Waiting Longest** – threads with the longest inactivity (prevents misses)
- **Unread First** – shows conversations with unread messages first

<Tip>
  **Tip:** Sorting changes the order of the list you’re already viewing (Open, Closed, or a filtered view). You can combine **Sort** with **Filters** for powerful inbox views.
</Tip>

## Search Conversations and Messages

Search in the **Inbox** is scoped to **conversations and their messages**.

- Use the **search bar** at the top of the app and type your query.
- You’ll see **recent searches**, plus quick actions to **Compose** or **Create a contact**.
- There’s also a shortcut to **Search in Contacts** if you’re looking for a person.

**Why aren’t contacts in the Inbox search:**\
MessageDesk treats **conversations** and **contacts** as separate entities. That’s how you can text **anonymous contacts** (numbers without a saved contact record) and still find those threads later by message content or conversation.

**How to narrow your search results:**\
Toggle the search scope to focus on **Messages** (specific words inside messages) or **Conversations** (by thread).

<Tip>
  **Tip:** Searching for a person? Jump to the [**Contacts module**](/contacts/anonymous-opt-out-blocked) to search by name and other contact details.
</Tip>

## Sort conversations in any Inbox view

1. Click the **Sort** icon above your conversation list.
2. Choose **Newest**, **Oldest**, **Waiting Longest**, or **Unread First**.
3. Your list updates immediately.

**When to use which:**

- **Newest** for real-time triage
- **Oldest** to finish and close out older work
- **Waiting Longest** for follow-ups and SLAs
- **Unread First** for “what needs doing right now”

## How to Apply a Custom Filter to Your Inbox View

Filter by **Labels**, **Assignee**, or **Workspace phone** to build focused inbox views.

1. From any Inbox view, click the **Filter** icon.
2. Choose **Match ALL filters** or **Match ANY filters**:
   - **ALL** = a conversation must meet **every** condition
   - **ANY** = a conversation can meet **any** one of the conditions
3. Pick a **property** to filter by:
   - **Labels** – select one or more labels
   - **Assignee** – select one or more teammates
   - **Workspace phone** – select one or more numbers
4. Click **Apply Filter** to update your list, or **Clear Filters** to reset.

<Tip>
  **Tip:** Start broad with **ANY**, then tighten to **ALL** as your inbox view shrinks.
</Tip>

## Combine Sort + Filters (Compound Queries)

You can layer **Sort** on top of an active **Filter** to create compound views.\
Examples:

- **Filter:** Labels = Support + Urgent → **Sort:** Waiting Longest
- **Filter:** Assignee = You → **Sort:** Unread First
- **Filter:** Workspace phone = (555) 555-0100 → **Sort:** Oldest

---

## Share a filtered view with teammates

1. After applying filters (and choosing a sort), click the **Share** icon.
2. The **unique URL** will be copied directly to your clipboard, and you can send it to any MessageDesk user in your workspace.
3. They’ll land on the exact same filtered/sorted view.

<Note>
  Great for daily stand-ups: “Work from this filtered view today.”
</Note>

## Examples: Ways to Sort and Filter Conversations

**Close-out an old list of conversations**

- Filter: Assignee = You
- Sort: Oldest
- Goal: Close or comment on everything older than 48h

**Catch-up on urgent support requests**

- Filter: Labels = Support, Urgent (Match ANY)
- Sort: Waiting Longest
- Goal: First response within target time

**Triage new messages by phone number**

- Filter: Workspace phone = Front desk line
- Sort: Unread First
- Goal: Keep the public line clear and responsive

## FAQ

**Can I save a filter permanently as a named view?**\
You can share a link to a filtered/sorted view. (If you use the same filters often, bookmark those URLs.)

**Why didn’t my person’s name appear in the Inbox search?**\
Inbox search looks at conversations/messages. To search **by contact name**, use **Search** in the **Contacts** module.

**Do filters change what my teammates see?**\
No. Filters affect **your** current view only—unless you share the link.

**Can I filter by multiple labels, assignees, etc.?**\
Yes. Select as many as you need and choose **ALL** or **ANY** to control matching.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **My results look empty.**\
  Check if **Match ALL** is too strict. Try **Match ANY** or clear one condition.
- **I can’t find a conversation I’m sure exists.**\
  Confirm you’re searching **Messages** vs **Conversations** appropriately. Clear filters and try again.
- **The share link sent my teammate to a different list.**\
  Make sure they have access to the same workspace numbers/labels and that the link wasn’t altered.

## Best practices

- **Search first, then filter.** A quick keyword search can narrow the conversation haystack.
- **Use consistent labels.** Filters are only as good as your labeling habits.
- **Work oldest-first on close-out.** Then switch back to **Newest** for live triage.
- **Share your filters.** Drop a link in a [Comment](/inbox/comments-mentions) so everyone’s working the same list.
