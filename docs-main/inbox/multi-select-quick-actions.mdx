# Multi-Select to Take Quick Actions from Any Inbox View

Move faster by selecting multiple conversations and applying bulk actions—right from the conversation list. Works in **sorted**, **filtered**, and **pre-saved** inbox views.

---

## How to Multi-Select Conversations & Apply Quick Actions

1. In any Inbox list, click **Select**.
2. Check up to **25 conversations** (per page).
3. Choose a **Quick Action**:

- **Close** – close selected threads and move them to the **Closed Inbox**
- **Start Group Message** – create **one group thread** (max **7 contacts**)
- **Reply-All** – send **one individual reply per conversation** (replies stay private in each thread)
- **Apply label** – add a label to all selected conversations
- **Assign to teammate** – bulk-assign all selected to one teammate
- **Clear selection** – unselect everything

<Tip>
  **Tip:** Need to message **more than 25** people at once? Use **Contacts** → multi-select → **Compose** to send a broadcast to **up to 100** recipients (send individually).

## Multi-Select Best Practices

- **Filter first, then select:** Narrow the list by **Label/Assignee/Phone Line** before bulk actions.
- **Use templates:** With **Reply-All**, insert a template, personalize if needed, then send.
- **Mind the limits:** Max **25** selected at once; **Group Message** limited to **7** participants.
- **Choose the right tool:** For one-to-many notices, a **broadcast** from **Contacts** is usually better than Reply-All.

## Frequently Asked Multi-Select Questions

**Does Reply-All create a group thread?**\
No. It sends **separate** messages—each reply stays in its own private conversation.

**Can I apply more than one label in bulk?**\
Yes. Use **Apply label** and select all labels you want to add.

**Will bulk assign overwrite current owners?**\
Yes. The selected teammate becomes the assignee on **all** selected conversations.

**Can I undo a bulk close or assign?**\
There’s no one-click undo. Reopen or reassign affected threads individually (or re-run a bulk action on a filtered list).

**Can I select across multiple pages?**\
Selection applies to the **current page**. Work page by page (up to **25** per page).

## Troubleshooting

- **Actions are greyed out.**\
  Ensure at least one conversation is selected, and you have permission to perform that action.
- **Group Message option missing/greyed out.**\
  You may have selected more than **7** conversations. Deselect until you’re at 7 or fewer.
- **Reply-All is greyed out.**

  Make sure you don't have a group conversation selected in your list. You can't reply to all in a group text thread using the multi-select function.
- **Didn’t reach everyone.**\
  For larger sends, switch to a **broadcast** via **Contacts** (up to **100** recipients per send).
