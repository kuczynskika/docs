# What is a Shared Team Inbox? MessageDesk Inbox Overview

Your MessageDesk **Inbox** is the shared place where you and your team send, receive, and manage SMS/MMS across your connected phone numbers.

Everyone sees the same conversation history, can add internal comments, assign owners, apply labels, and keep work moving—without juggling personal phones.

## Why a Shared Team SMS Inbox Matters

- **Unified view:** See texts **and** internal comments in a single thread with full history.
- **Team alignment:** Assign owners, @mention teammates, and close resolved threads.
- **Organization at scale:** Filter by phone line, labels, or assignees so nothing slips.
- **Faster resolution:** Work the right queue (Unread, Waiting Longest, etc.) and finish more conversations per day.

## How MessageDesk Organizes Your Inbox (At a Glance)

### **Top navigation (modules)**

- **Inbox** – shared team space for all text conversations
- **Contacts** – saved contact records and lists

## Add Teammates to Collaborate in Your Inbox

MessageDesk works best with your team inside.

### **Why add teammates:**

- **Visibility:** See who’s working what, with full context.
- **Collaboration:** Assign owners, [**@mention**](/inbox/comments-mentions) for help, share [**templates**](/messaging/templates-tags) and [**labels**](/inbox/labels).
- **Permissions:** Control access by [**roles and permissions**](/settings/personal/overview) to specific phone lines, teammate inboxes, and labels.

### **Where to start:**

- Invite teammates and set roles/permissions to control access to **phone lines**, **teammate inboxes**, and **labels**.

- Pick **Recipients** (search, paste numbers, or pick from Contacts)
- Choose **Send from** (which connected phone number)
- Compose your **Message** (use templates, add media, insert emoji)

<Tip>
  **Tip:** For best deliverability with business texting, complete [**carrier registration (10DLC)**](/carrier-registration/overview) for each connected phone number before sending texts.
</Tip>

### My Inbox (personal working views)

- **My conversations** – assigned to you right now
- **Sent** – threads where you’ve sent a message
- **Anonymous** – numbers (conversations) not yet linked to a contact
- **Scheduled** – past and upcoming scheduled texts
- **Mentions** – comments where teammates @mentioned you

Use these views to focus your day without losing sight of the bigger picture.

![My Inbox Pn](/docs-main/images/my-inbox.png)

### Phone Numbers (all lines or per-line)

- **All Conversations** – everything across every connected phone number
- Click a specific **phone line** to view only the conversations on that number
- Connect up to **48** phone lines to your workspace

This helps teams split work by department (Front Desk, Support, Sales) while keeping a unified history.

### Team (see a teammate’s conversations)

After you invite users, each teammate appears as a view. Click a teammate to see what’s **assigned** to them—useful for coverage, support, and handoffs.

### Labels (fast organization)

Labels add color + icon + text to conversations so you can group and find related work (e.g., **Support: Urgent**, **Sales: Proposal**, **Ops: Region – West**). Clicking a label shows all conversations tagged with it.

<Tip>
  **Tip:** Create a small, shared set of labels with team-friendly names and colors. Consistency beats quantity.

## Core Inbox Actions You’ll Use Every Day

- **Assign** a conversation to a teammate (ownership prevents double replies)
- **Comment** internally (yellow composer) and **@mention** the next owner
- **Close** resolved threads; they’ll reopen automatically on new activity
- **Label** for easy filtering and reporting
- **Multi-select** to take quick actions on conversations in bulk
- **Search, sort, filter** to build focused queues (Unread First, Waiting Longest, by label/assignee/line)

---

## Best Inbox Practices

- **One owner per live thread.** Assign early; reassign on handoff with a comment.
- **Close what’s done.** Keeps the Open Inbox clean and accurate.
- **Use templates + tags.** Respond faster and stay on-brand.
- **Segment by line.** Give each department a dedicated number for clarity.
- **Standardize labels.** Agree on names and colors so filters stay useful.

## FAQ

**Does the Inbox change message deliverability?**\
No. Open/Closed/Assigned/Labels affect **team workflow** only, not sending.

**Can I restrict who sees which phone lines?**\
Yes. Use roles and permissions to limit access to specific lines and teammate inboxes.

**Do comments go to customers?**\
No. Comments are internal-only. You’ll see a yellow composer when commenting.

**How many recipients can I message at once?**\
Up to **100** per message sent (each reply comes back as a private 1-on-1 message).

**Can I upload and reuse files?**\
Yes. Attach media from your computer or Workspace files; larger files are sent as secure links.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **I can’t find a conversation**\
  Clear filters, check you’re on the right **phone line** view, then use **Search** (by message content or conversation). For **contact names**, search in **Contacts**.
- **I don’t see Assign/Close/Labels**\
  Open a specific thread and check your **permissions**.
- **Too many labels to manage**\
  Consolidate with prefixes (e.g., `Support:`, `Sales:`), archive duplicates, and document your naming rules.
