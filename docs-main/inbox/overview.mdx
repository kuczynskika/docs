# What is a Shared Team Inbox? MessageDesk Inbox Overview

MessageDesk organizes all of your text messaging around specific phone numbers, unifying conversations into one view for your whole team. MessageDesk's inbox provides a complete conversation history for better texting and team collaboration.

## What is a Shared Team SMS Inbox?

A shared team SMS inbox is a space for all of your text messaging across all of your connected phone numbers. The inbox makes it possible to view, organize, route, assign, and close open text message conversations as a team.

### Key benefits

## Inbox Organization & Navigation

We designed MessageDesk's inbox for ease of use and accessibility. The idea is to keep things as simple and actionable as possible so that you and your team can resolve conversations as quickly as possible.

### Modules (Inbox, Contacts, Relays)

At the top of the inbox, you'll find navigation items for MessageDesk's three main modules: Inbox, Contacts, and Relays.

- **Inbox:** The shared team space where you'll see all text message conversations
- **Contacts:** The home for all of your saved contacts in MessageDesk
- **Relays:** A hub for all automation and workflows tied to your MessageDesk workspace

### My Inbox

Filtered views or sub-inboxes make up the layout of MessageDesk's inbox. The first filtered view you'll find in the navigation is My Inbox. Here you'll see filtered views for:

- **My conversations:** A view of all conversations currently assigned to you.
- **Sent:** A view of all conversations where you have sent a message.
- **Anonymous:** A view of all conversations (just phone numbers) that are not linked to contacts.
- **Scheduled:** A historical and present view of all scheduled text messages across conversations.
- **Mentions:** A view of conversations where you're mentioned within a comment inside the conversation thread.

### Phone Numbers

Expand the **Phone Number dropdown** in the inbox navigation, and you'll see all phone numbers currently connected to your MessageDesk inbox. You can connect up to 48 phone lines to your MessageDesk inbox.

By default, you'll see a filtered view for **All Conversations**. This is a view of all text message conversations across all phone lines connected to MessageDesk.

Alternatively, you can click a phone line to view all text conversations taking place on that phone number.

### Team

You'll see individual teammate inboxes as filtered views after inviting new users to your MessageDesk workspace.

The team view gives you a way to view text conversations assigned to other teammates. This gives you a quick way to understand what conversations they're working on or assigned to.

Click a teammate from the view to see all of their conversations.

### Labels

Labels give you and your team a powerful way to organize conversations into groups. Once you create and apply a label to a conversation, you'll see it filter into that label's view in your inbox.

Click the label to view all conversations tagged with that label.
