# Organize & Group Conversations With Labels in MessageDesk

Labels help you sort, find, and manage conversations fast—without creating complicated folder structures.

A label is a small badge made of **text + color + icon** that you can apply to any conversation.

---

## Why Use Labels?

- **Stay organized:** Group related conversations across teams and topics.
- **Work faster:** Scan your inbox and spot priorities by color/icon.
- **Report & review:** Filter by label to see everything for a project, region, or status.
- **Keep it simple:** Add or remove labels anytime—no impact on message delivery.

<Note>
  **Good to know:** You can add **multiple labels** to the same conversation.
</Note>

## Common Label Ideas (by Team)

**Logistics / Dispatch**

- **Drivers** – conversations with field staff
- **Region: North** / **Region: South** – geographic routing
- **Urgent** – time-sensitive jobs

**HR**

- **Benefits** – questions and announcements
- **New hire** – onboarding conversations

**Support / Success**

- **Support** – active cases
- **Review-ready** – happy customers to invite for a review
- **Bug** – product issues to track

**Sales / Ops**

- **Proposal** – outstanding quotes
- **Order** – order updates
- **Won** / **Lost** – quick stage markers

<Tip>
  **Tip:** Use a short **prefix** for clarity (e.g., `HR: New hire`, `Sales: Proposal`, `Support: Bug`).
</Tip>

## Label a Conversation (from the Inbox)

1. Open a conversation.
2. Click the **Label** icon (top-right of the thread).
3. Check one or more labels to apply them.
4. Close the menu—the labels appear above the thread and in the conversation list.

**Remove a label:** Reopen the **Label** menu and uncheck it.

<Note>
  **Note:** Labels without a custom icon will display a placeholder label icon in the menu.

Once you label a conversation, you'll see all conversation labels associated with that conversation in the Inbox conversations view.

## Create & Edit Labels (Quickly from the Message Thread)

1. Open a conversation → click the **Label** icon.
2. Click **Create label** (or **Edit labels**).
3. Set **Name**, **Color**, and **Icon** → **Save**.

<Tip>
  **Best practice:** Keep names short and scannable. Prefer `Proposal – ACME` over `All proposals currently outstanding for ACME Corp`.
</Tip>

## Create & Manage Labels (Workspace Settings)

Admins can manage labels for everyone.

1. Go to **Account → Settings**.
2. Under **Workspace Settings**, open **Inbox Settings → Labels**.
3. **Create**, **rename**, **change color/icon**, or **remove** labels.

**Reorder label appearance:** Update your **Inbox layout** in settings to control label order in lists.

<Warning>
  **Heads up:** Renaming a label updates it **everywhere** it’s used.
</Warning>

<Tip>
  **Tip:** Need to reorganize or reorder the way labels appear in your inbox? You can adjust their order by [updating your inbox layout in settings](/settings/personal).
</Tip>

## Find Conversations by Label

- Open your **Inbox** and use the **filter/search** to show conversations with a specific label.
- Save common filters (e.g., `Support + Urgent`) as a **view,** so your team can jump in fast.

---

## Label Naming & Color Conventions (Recommended)

- **Keep it short:** 1–2 words or a word + emoji/icon.
- **Use prefixes:** `HR:`, `Ops:`, `Sales:`, `Support:`.
- **Color with intent:**
  - Green = success/ready
  - Yellow = waiting/attention
  - Red = urgent/blocker
- **Avoid duplicates:** One meaning per label name.

**Examples**

- `Support: Urgent`
- `Sales: Proposal`
- `Ops: Region – West`
- `HR: New hire`
- `Review-ready`

## Frequently Asked Label Questions

**Can I apply more than one label to a conversation?**\
Yes. Apply as many as you need.

**Do labels affect who can see a conversation or whether messages send?**\
No. Labels don’t change permissions or deliverability—they’re for organization and filtering only.

**Can I edit or delete a label later?**\
Yes. Edit the name/color/icon anytime from **Inbox (Label menu)** or **Workspace Settings**. Deleting/archiving a label removes it from conversations.

**Can I filter by more than one label at a time?**\
Yes. Combine labels in a filter to narrow your view (e.g., `Support` + `Urgent`).

## Troubleshooting

- **I don’t see the Label icon.**\
  Make sure you’re inside a conversation, not just the inbox list. If it’s still missing, check your workspace permissions.
- **I created a label, but teammates can’t find it.**\
  Ask them to refresh the inbox. Confirm you created it in **Workspace Settings** if it should be available to everyone.
- **We have too many similar labels.**\
  Standardize names with prefixes, merge duplicates (rename to the preferred label, then archive the old one), and document your naming rules in a short internal note.
