# Organize & Group Conversations With Labels in MessageDesk

## What Are Labels in MessageDesk?

Labels are a lightweight but powerful MessageDesk feature designed to help you organize and manage conversations across your workspace.

A label can be anything in MessageDesk (it's a combination of an icon, a color, and some text).

Teams label conversations in many different ways, but here are some examples:

#### **Logistics/dispatch label examples:**

- **Drivers** - (a label for grouping all drivers)
- **Regions** - (a label for grouping conversations by specific region)

#### **HR labels examples:**

- **Benefits** - (a label for coordinating benefits announcements)
- **New hires** - (a label for grouping conversations for new employees)

#### Support/customer service examples:

- **Support** - (a label for grouping conversations with existing customers regarding support)
- **Review qualified** - (a label for identifying happy customers who might leave a positive review)

#### Sales labels examples:

- **Proposals** - (a label for grouping all conversations related to outstanding proposals)
- **Orders** - (a label for managing conversations regarding orders)

## How to Create, Apply, and Manage Labels in the Inbox

#### 1. How to label a conversation

Open an active conversation in the Inbox.

At the top, far right of the conversation thread, you'll see a label icon.

Click the icon to expand the labels menu and select as many labels as you like.

Additionally, you'll find buttons for creating a new label or editing existing labels.

Once you label a conversation, you'll see all conversation labels associated with that conversation in the Inbox conversations view.
