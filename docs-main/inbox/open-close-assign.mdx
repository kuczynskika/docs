# Manage Open, Closed & Assigned Conversations

## What Do Open and Closed Mean in MessageDesk?

Keep your inbox focused and your team aligned by marking conversations **Open** or **Closed** and assigning owners.

#### What “Open” and “Closed” mean

- **Open** = active and needs attention. You or a teammate is working the thread.
- **Closed** = resolved and archived from your active view. Reopen anytime.

<Note>
  **Why it matters:** Closing finished threads reduces clutter and helps your team see what truly needs action.
</Note>

## Why Do Open and Closed Conversations Matter?

As teams text and conversation volume increases, it's important to keep things organized. We consider it an inbox best practice to close a conversation once it's effectively resolved or has been handled.

Not only does closing a conversation reduce clutter for yourself, but it also helps your teammates maintain a clear view of what conversations really need resolution in MessageDesk.

## Inbox views (filters)

Your inbox is a set of saved filters. By default you’ll see:

- **Open Inbox** – all active conversations
- **Closed Inbox** – conversations you’ve closed

<Tip>
  **Tip:** Your inbox defaults to **Open Inbox**. Look for the **Open Inbox** label/icon above the conversation list.
</Tip>

### View open conversations

1. Go to **Inbox**.
2. Confirm the **Open Inbox** filter is selected.
3. Click any conversation to work it.

All new conversations start **Open** by default.

### Close a conversation

1. Open the conversation.
2. Click **Close** (above the thread).
3. The conversation disappears from your left-hand list and moves to **Closed Inbox**.

<Tip>
  **Tip:** Close a thread once the request is resolved or no action is needed.
</Tip>

### View closed conversations

1. In **Inbox**, switch to **Closed Inbox**.
2. You’ll see a list of closed threads.
3. Click any thread to review or reopen.

After you click on Closed Inbox, your inbox view will change, and you'll see a list of closed conversations. You'll know you're in the closed inbox because the **Closed Icon** will be visible.

### Reopen a closed conversation

- **Manual:** In a closed thread, click **Open** to move it back to **Open Inbox**.
- **Automatic:** Any **new message** sent in a closed thread (inbound or outbound) reopens it and marks it **Unread** in **Open Inbox**.

<Note>
  By default, any new message sent within a closed conversation thread will reopen that conversation in the Open Inbox and display an unread icon next to the conversation.
</Note>

## Assign a Conversation to Teammates

Use conversation assignment to make ownership clear and avoid double work.

1. Open the conversation.
2. Click the **Assign (person)** icon (top-right).
3. Select one or multiple teammates.
4. Assigned teammates keep access to that thread.

<Tip>
  **Tip:** Use a quick internal [**comment**](/inbox/comments-mentions) to leave a message for a teammate when reassigning conversations.
</Tip>

## Frequently Asked Open, Closed, and Assignment Questions

**Do closed conversations stay closed forever?**\
No. You can reopen any time. New activity also reopens the thread automatically.

**Can multiple teammates be assigned?**\
Yes. Assign one or many.

**What happens when I close a conversation by mistake?**\
Open **Closed Inbox**, select the thread, and click **Open** to restore it.

**Will my teammate be notified when I assign a conversation?**\
If notifications are enabled for them, they’ll receive one (per their notification settings).

## Troubleshooting

- **I don’t see the Close or Open button.**\
  Confirm you’re viewing a specific conversation (not just the list) and that you have permission to update its state.
- **My closed thread didn’t reopen when I replied.**\
  Make sure your reply was sent in that thread and not as a new message to the same contact.

## Best Practices

- **Close fast, reopen when needed.** Keeps the team’s working queue clean.
- **Assign on first touch.** Ownership prevents duplicate replies.
- **Leave a comment on handoff.** Summarize the situation and the next step.
- **Review the Closed Inbox weekly.** Spot repeat issues and training opportunities.
