# Manage Open, Closed & Assigned Conversation States

## What Do Open and Closed Mean in MessageDesk?

Open and Closed refer to a text message conversation's active state.

#### Open conversations

Open conversations are active. These are conversations that you or a teammate are actively responding to or managing.

#### Closed conversations

Closed conversations are inactive conversations. Once you or a teammate "resolves" a conversation, it's an inbox best practice to "close" or archive that conversation.

## Why Do Open and Closed Conversations Matter?

As teams text and conversation volume increases, it's important to keep things organized. We consider it an inbox best practice to close a conversation once it's effectively resolved or has been handled.

Not only does closing a conversation reduce clutter for yourself, but it also helps your teammates maintain a clear view of what conversations really need resolution in MessageDesk.

## Open vs. Closed Inbox

Your MessageDesk inbox is actually a view of various pre-saved and customizable filtered views.

By default, your MessageDesk inbox comes with an Open Inbox filter and a Closed Inbox filter.

### How to view open conversations

All conversations in MessageDesk begin in the Open Inbox until they are marked as closed.

When you first open your inbox, it will default to the **Open Inbox view**. You'll know you're in this view if you see the **Open Inbox icon** above your conversations list.

### How to close an individual conversation

Once you click into a conversation, you'll see the option to **close** that conversation.

After you click Close, you'll see that the conversation is automatically removed from your conversation list on the left. 

### How to View Closed Conversations

To view closed conversations, you'll need to navigate to your**Closed Inbox** .

After you click on Closed Inbox, your inbox view will change, and you'll see a list of closed conversations. You'll know you're in the closed inbox because the **Closed Icon** will be visible.

### How to reopen a closed conversation

You can manually re-open a closed conversation at any time in MessageDesk. To reopen a closed conversation, navigate to the **Closed view** in your inbox and **select a closed conversation**.

Above the conversation thread, click **Open** to reopen the conversation and move it back to your **Open Inbox view**.

<Note>
  By default, any new message sent within a closed conversation thread will reopen that conversation in the Open Inbox and display an unread icon next to the conversation.

## How to Assign a Conversation to a Teammate

You can assign conversations to teammates by clicking the `person` icon in the top-right corner of the conversation.

- You can assign 1 or many teammates to a conversation.
- A teammate will always have access to conversations they are assigned to.
