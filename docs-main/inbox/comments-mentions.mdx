# Comments & Mentions for Team Collaboration in MessageDesk

Use **comments** to leave internal notes in a conversation.\
Use **mentions** to notify teammates and move work forward—without sending a text to the contact.

## What Are Comments?

- **Not SMS** – contacts never see them
- Great for handoffs, approvals, context, and reminders

<Note>
  You’ll know you’re in **comment mode** when the message compose box turns **purple (when using the default MessageDesk color theme)**.
</Note>

<Warning>
  Comments, threaded comments, and mentions are currently **read-only** on **mobile** devices. Later releases will expand mobile functionality.
</Warning>

## Common Ways Teams Use Comments & Mentions

- **Handoffs:** “@Sam customer confirmed 2pm; please send prep checklist.”
- **Approvals:** “@Alex can you approve refund before I close?”
- **Triage:** “@Support urgent billing issue—see last two messages.”
- **Coaching:** “@Jordan reply with template ‘Appt reminder – 24h’ next time.”
- **Self-reminders:** “@Me follow up Friday if no response.”

---

## Tips & Best Practices

- **Keep one comment = one ask.** Makes it easier to scan and act.
- **Summarize before you @.** Add 1–2 lines of context and the next step.
- **Mention the owner.** Use @ on the assignee so nothing slips through.
- **Attach artifacts.** Drop photos, PDFs, or screenshots right in the comment.
- **Close the loop.** Post a short “Resolved—closing thread” comment before you close.

---

## Privacy & Visibility

- Comments are **never** sent to contacts.
- Mentions **notify teammates** (via email) and link back to the exact thread.
- Comments live **inside the conversation** for full history and auditing.

## Troubleshooting

- **I don’t see the Comment option.**\
  Make sure you’re inside a conversation (not just the list). If it’s still missing, check with an admin about permissions.
- **My comment looked like a text.**\
  Confirm you switched to **Comment** mode (yellow composer). If you sent while in **Message** mode, it went as SMS.
- **No one saw my mention.**\
  Verify you used **@** to pick specific teammates (not just typed their names). Ask them to check their email and spam folders.
