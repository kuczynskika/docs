# Comments & Mentions for Team Collaboration in MessageDesk

Comments and mentions are powerful tools for coordinating and collaborating as a team.

Instead of sending a text, you can simply mention another MessageDesk user on your team and leave them a comment in a text message thread.

Here's how comments and mentions work.

## What are Comments in MessageDesk?

Comments are a way to leave internal notes for yourself and other teammates in text message threads.

Comments are NOT text messages - these are non-SMS messages saved inside of MessageDesk text threads and only visible to yourself and other MessageDesk teammates.

Comments are never revealed to text message recipients in a text thread.

## What are Mentions in MessageDesk?

Mentions are a way to notify or "@" a teammate in your MessageDesk workspace.

Mentions give you a way to direct other teammates to view, assess, respond to, or generally take action around a text message conversation.

Mentions are meant to help you coordinate and collaborate with other teammates around and inside of external text conversations.

## How to Leave a Comment with a Mention in MessageDesk

### 1. From the Inbox, Click into a Conversation

### 2. Click the Message type dropdown and select Comment

You'll notice that your message compose box changes to a yellow color.

This means you're now in "comment mode" inside of the text thread - you're no longer sending text messages, instead you'll be leaving internal messages, "comments" inside of MessageDesk.

### 4. Compose your comment and click send

Once you click send, you'll see your comment published in the center of the text thread alongside any other previous comments.

  You can click the + button in the comment compose box to [share media/images](/messaging/media) within comments as well!

### 5. See where you mentioned via email notification

Once your comment posts to the message thread, each MessageDesk user you've mentioned in your comment will receive an email notification.

This notification will direct them to the inbox where the comment and text thread are located.

Click into a comment to view the message thread.
