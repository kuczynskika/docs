# Team Collaboration: Comments, Mentions & Emoji Reactions

Work together seamlessly inside MessageDesk without ever sending an unintended text. Use **comments** for internal notes, **mentions** to alert teammates, and **emoji reactions** to respond quickly without typing a message.

---

## Comments

### What are comments?

Comments are **internal-only notes** that appear inside a text thread but are **never sent to contacts**.\
They’re ideal for:

- Internal handoffs
- Approvals or QA reviews
- Providing context before responding
- Adding reminders or documentation

<Note>
  You’ll know you’re in **comment mode** when the compose box turns **purple** (default theme).
</Note>

<Warning>
  On **mobile**, comments, threaded replies, and mentions are currently **read-only**. Full functionality is coming soon.
</Warning>

---

## Mentions

### What are mentions?

Mentions let you notify teammates directly within a conversation.

- Type **@** to mention one or more teammates (you can even @yourself).
- Mentions trigger **email** and **browser notifications** linking to the conversation.
- Great for follow-ups, approvals, or assigning the next step.

**Example:**\
“@Jordan please confirm details before closing this ticket.”

---

## Emoji Reactions

### What are emoji reactions?

Emoji reactions allow you to quickly acknowledge or respond to messages and comments without typing a full reply.

- Available on both **messages** and **non-threaded comments**
- Displayed in the **top-left** corner of a message or comment
- Show a **count of unique reactions** (hover or click to see who reacted)

**When to use reactions**

- 👍 Confirm you’ve seen a message
- 🎉 Celebrate a win
- ❤️ Show appreciation
- 👀 Indicate “reviewing” without replying

---

## How to Use Comments, Mentions & Reactions

![Mention Teammate Pn](/docs-main/images/mention-teammate.png)

<Note>
  Mentioning yourself is a great way to set reminders or flag items for follow-up.
</Note>

### 4. Write and send your comment

Type your comment, then click **Send**. It will appear in the thread but **not** be sent as a text.

- Optional: Click **\+** to [attach media](/messaging/media) (images, files, etc.)
- Switch back to **Message** mode to send an actual SMS.

## Finding Comments You’re Mentioned In

1. Go to your **Inbox**.
2. Open **My Inbox** (left sidebar).
3. Select the pre-saved view for **Comments you’re mentioned in**.
4. Click a conversation to jump directly to your mention.

![View All Mentions Pn](/docs-main/images/view-all-mentions.png)

---

## Searching for Comments

You can search for comments across your workspace using global search.

1. Press **⌘K** (Mac) or **Ctrl+K** (Windows) to open global search, or click the search bar.
2. Type your search query.
3. Toggle the search scope to **Comments** to focus on internal notes and discussions.
4. Click a result to navigate directly to the conversation containing that comment.

<Note>
  Search respects your existing permissions—you'll only see comments from conversations you have access to.
</Note>

---

## Comment Threads

### What are comment threads?

Threads let you reply directly to a specific comment or message—keeping related discussions together.

- Organize back-and-forth discussions
- Keep follow-ups separate from the main message feed
- Available on desktop (hover) and mobile (force touch)

![Comment Thread Pn](/docs-main/images/comment-thread.png)

### How to reply in a thread

1. Hover over a comment or message → click **Reply**
2. Type your reply
3. Click **Send**

<Note>
  You can reply from the **original comment** or the **last message** in a thread—both add to the same thread.
</Note>

![New Comment Thread Posted Pn](/docs-main/images/new-comment-thread-posted.png)

### Best times to use threads

- **Follow-ups:** Ask clarifying questions without cluttering the main chat
- **Status updates:** Keep progress notes in one place
- **Focused discussions:** Avoid cross-talk in busy conversations

---

## Deleting comments

You can delete comments you no longer need. Comments are **soft-deleted**—they are removed from view but remain in the database for record-keeping purposes.

### How to delete a comment

1. Hover over the comment in the conversation thread
2. Click the **trash can icon** (🗑️)
3. The comment will be deleted

### What happens when you delete a comment

- **Individual comments** (non-threaded): Disappear from the conversation pane entirely
- **Threaded comments**: A placeholder showing "Comment was deleted" remains to preserve thread context

<Note>
  Deleted comments are soft-deleted. While they no longer appear in the conversation, they are retained in the database and will still appear in **conversation exports**.
</Note>

## Tips & Best Practices

- ✅ **Keep one comment = one ask.** Easier to read and act on.
- 🧭 **Add context before tagging.** Summarize the issue or goal.
- 👥 **Mention the owner.** Tag the responsible teammate so nothing slips through.
- 📎 **Attach files.** Use screenshots, PDFs, or photos for clarity.
- 🔁 **Close the loop.** Add a “Resolved—closing thread” note when finished.
- ⚡ **React instead of reply.** Use emojis for quick acknowledgments to reduce noise.

---

## Privacy & Visibility

- Comments are **internal only** – never sent to contacts.
- Mentions trigger **email/browser notifications** to the tagged teammates.
- Comments remain in the conversation for **historical context and auditing**.

## FAQ

**Do comments send to the customer?**\
No. They’re internal-only.

The composer turns **purple**, and the message type shows **Comment**.

**Can I mention multiple teammates?**\
Yes. You can mention as many as needed.

**Can I attach media to a comment?**\
Yes. Use the **\+** icon to upload files or images.

**Will I get notified if someone mentions me?**\
Yes. Mentions trigger **email** and **browser** notifications.

**How do I reply to a specific comment or message?**\
Hover over it → click **Reply** → your message appears as a **threaded reply**.

**Can I see all my mentions in one place?**\
Yes. In **My Inbox**, use the **"Comments you're mentioned in"** view.

---

## Troubleshooting

**I don’t see the Comment option.**\
Ensure you’re inside a specific conversation (not just the list). If still missing, check with your admin about permissions.

**Can I search for comments?**\\
Yes. Use global search (**⌘K** / **Ctrl+K**) and toggle the scope to **Comments**. Results link directly to the conversation.

**My comment sent as a text.**\
You were likely in **Message** mode. Switch to **Comment** (purple composer) before sending.

**Mentions aren’t notifying teammates.**\
Confirm you used **@** to select teammates from the dropdown (not just typed names).\
Ask teammates to check email spam/junk folders if no notification appears.
