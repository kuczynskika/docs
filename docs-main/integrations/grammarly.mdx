# Grammarly Integration

Check spelling, grammar, and tone as you compose messages in MessageDesk using **Grammarly**—a free browser extension that works anywhere you type.

<Note>
  MessageDesk does not include built-in spell check. Grammarly is a third-party tool that adds this functionality to your browser.

## What Grammarly does

Grammarly checks your writing in real-time as you type in MessageDesk:

- **Spelling** — Catches typos and misspelled words
- **Grammar** — Flags grammatical errors and suggests corrections
- **Punctuation** — Identifies missing or incorrect punctuation
- **Tone** — Analyzes your message tone (friendly, formal, confident, etc.)
- **Clarity** — Suggests ways to make your writing clearer and more concise

Corrections appear as underlined suggestions directly in the compose field. Click a suggestion to accept it, or ignore it to keep your original text.
