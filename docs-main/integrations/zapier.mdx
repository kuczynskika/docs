# Zapier Integration

Connect MessageDesk to the rest of your stack with **Zapier**. Use triggers from MessageDesk to start workflows in other apps, or use actions to **create/update contacts** and **send messages** when events happen elsewhere.

---

## What You Can Automate

- **When a message arrives** → create a helpdesk ticket, post to Slack, log to Sheets.
- **When you send a message** → update your CRM timeline, create a follow-up task.
- **When a workspace is created** → kick off onboarding in your PM tool.
- **From your CRM or forms** → create/update contacts in MessageDesk or **send a text**.

<Note>
  **Prerequisites:** A Zapier account and a MessageDesk workspace. Outbound texting through Zapier follows the same [**registration**](/carrier-registration/overview), [**deliverability**](/messaging/delivery-status-errors), and [**compliance**](/settings/compliance-center) rules as sending inside MessageDesk.
</Note>

## How Zapier Works (Two Building Blocks)

- **Triggers** – the event that starts your Zap.
- **Actions** – what Zapier does after the trigger fires.

---

## MessageDesk Triggers

| Trigger              | What it does                                                  |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Message received** | Fires when a new inbound message hits your MessageDesk inbox. |
| **Message sent**     | Fires when an outbound message is sent from MessageDesk.      |
| **New workspace**    | Fires when a new workspace is created.                        |

### Trigger payload (fields you’ll see)

**Message received / sent**

- `message_id`, `message_body`
- `from_phone`, `to_phone`
- `contact_id`, `contact_name` (if known)
- `timestamp`
- `sent_by` (for _Message sent_)

**New workspace**

- `workspace_id`, `workspace_name`, `created_at`

---

## MessageDesk Actions

| Action                       | What it does                                                                |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Create or update contact** | Creates a new contact or updates an existing one (matched by phone number). |
| **Send message**             | Sends an SMS to a single phone number from your MessageDesk line.           |

### Action inputs & outputs

**Create or update contact – inputs**

- **Phone number** (required, used for matching)
- First name, Last name, Email (optional)
- Custom fields (optional, must exist in your workspace)

**Create or update contact – outputs**

- `contact_id`
- `created` (true/false)
- `updated` (true/false)

**Send message – inputs**

- **To phone number** (required)
- **Message body** (required)
- From phone number (optional; defaults to primary workspace line)

**Send message – outputs**

- `message_id`
- `status` (e.g., Sent/Delivered/Failed)
- `sent_at`

> **Note:** Messages sent via Zapier **count toward your MessageDesk usage** and are subject to the same carrier policies and delivery statuses as messages sent from the Inbox.

## Build Your First MessageDesk Zap

### 1. Login or create your Zapier account

Visit [**zapier.com**](zapier.com) to log in or create a new account.

### 2. Click to create a new Zap

![Create New Zap Pn](/docs-main/images/create-new-zap.png)

### 3. Search for **MessageDesk** in the app directory

<Warning>
  **Warning:** Be sure to select the proper **app version (1.1.0)** for the beta release.
</Warning>

![Zapier Version Pn](/docs-main/images/zapier-version.png)

<Note>
  Note: You can use MessageDesk as both a **trigger** for your zap, as well as an **action**.
</Note>

![Trigger Or Action Pn](/docs-main/images/trigger-or-action.png)

### 4. Select a Trigger and connect your MessageDesk account

If using MessageDesk as a trigger for your zap, select from:

1. **Message Received** (triggers when your MessageDesk workspace receives a message).
2. **Message Sent** (triggers whenever a message is sent out of MessageDesk.

Once you configure your trigger, you'll need to click **Select** to connect your MessageDesk account.

![Zapier Trigger Select Pn](/docs-main/images/zapier-trigger-select.png)

### 5. Configure your zap with your MessageDesk workspace and test.

Select the workspace you'd like your zap to work with from the list of workspaces associated with your account. Once you select your workspace, click continue and test the trigger.

![Zapier Select Workspace Pn](/docs-main/images/zapier-select-workspace.png)

### 5. Select Actions

MessageDesk currently supports two actions:

1. **Create or Update Contact** (Creates a contact or updates a contact if it already exists)
2. **Send Message** (Sends a message to an existing or new conversation)

![Zapier Actions Pn](/docs-main/images/zapier-actions.png)

## Common Recipes (Copy These Ideas)

- **CRM → MessageDesk:** When a lead is created, or a form is submitted → **Create/Update contact** → **Send message** (“Thanks for reaching out! Reply STOP to opt out.”)
- **MessageDesk → Slack:** **Message received** → Post the message and link to the thread in a team channel.
- **MessageDesk → Google Sheets:** **Message sent** → Append a row with `timestamp`, `to`, `from`, `message_body`, `status`.
- **Scheduling tool → MessageDesk:** Upcoming appointment in Calendly/Google Calendar → **Send message** reminder 24 hours before.

---

## Best Practices

- **Stay compliant:** Include opt-out language when appropriate (e.g., “Reply **STOP** to opt out”). Ensure **A2P 10DLC / Toll-Free verification** is complete before automating sends to US numbers.
- **Use E.164 formatting:** `+15551234567` for phone numbers to avoid failures.
- **Test with real data:** Run Zapier’s **Test** step and check the message in your MessageDesk thread.
- **Handle errors:** Add a Zapier step for **Paths/Filters** or **Error handling** (e.g., only send if a phone number is present).
- **Avoid blasting via Zapier:** For large sends, use MessageDesk **broadcasts**; Zapier actions send **one message per Zap run**.

## Troubleshooting

**Auth fails when connecting to MessageDesk**

- Reconnect the app in Zapier; ensure you’re logged into the correct workspace in MessageDesk and that your role has access.

**Action ‘Send message’ succeeds, but the delivery fails**

- Open the thread in MessageDesk and review **Delivery Status & Errors**. Check registration status, number formatting, content filters, and media size.

**Missing or incorrect contact data**

- Confirm Zap field mapping. Ensure custom fields exist in MessageDesk and types match.

**Zaps not triggering on inbound messages**

- Verify the trigger is **Message received** and that the workspace/line receiving the message matches the connected account. Send a fresh test message to fire the trigger.
