# Zapier Integration

Connect MessageDesk to the rest of your stack with **Zapier**. Use triggers from MessageDesk to start workflows in other apps, or use actions to **create/update contacts** and **send messages** when events happen elsewhere.

---

## What You Can Automate

- **When a message arrives** → create a helpdesk ticket, post to Slack, log to Sheets.
- **When you send a message** → update your CRM timeline, create a follow-up task.
- **When a workspace is created** → kick off onboarding in your PM tool.
- **From your CRM or forms** → create/update contacts in MessageDesk or **send a text**.

> **Prerequisites:** A Zapier account and a MessageDesk workspace. Outbound texting through Zapier follows the same [**registration**](/carrier-registration/overview), [**deliverability**](/messaging/delivery-status-errors), and [**compliance**](/settings/compliance-center) rules as sending inside MessageDesk.

## How Zapier Works (Two Building Blocks)

- **Trigger** – the event that starts your Zap.
- **Action** – what Zapier does after the trigger fires.

---

## MessageDesk Triggers

| Trigger              | What it does                                                  |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Message received** | Fires when a new inbound message hits your MessageDesk inbox. |
| **Message sent**     | Fires when an outbound message is sent from MessageDesk.      |
| **New workspace**    | Fires when a new workspace is created.                        |

### Trigger payload (fields you’ll see)

**Message received / sent**

- `message_id`, `message_body`
- `from_phone`, `to_phone`
- `contact_id`, `contact_name` (if known)
- `timestamp`
- `sent_by` (for _Message sent_)

**New workspace**

- `workspace_id`, `workspace_name`, `created_at`

## MessageDesk Actions

| Action                       | What it does                                                                |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Create or update contact** | Creates a new contact or updates an existing one (matched by phone number). |
| **Send message**             | Sends an SMS to a single phone number from your MessageDesk line.           |

### Action inputs & outputs

**Create or update contact – inputs**

- **Phone number** (required, used for matching)
- First name, Last name, Email (optional)
- Custom fields (optional, must exist in your workspace)

**Create or update contact – outputs**

- `contact_id`
- `created` (true/false)
- `updated` (true/false)

**Send message – inputs**

- **To phone number** (required)
- **Message body** (required)
- From phone number (optional; defaults to primary workspace line)

**Send message – outputs**

- `message_id`
- `status` (e.g., Sent/Delivered/Failed)
- `sent_at`

> **Note:** Messages sent via Zapier **count toward your MessageDesk usage** and are subject to the same carrier policies and delivery statuses as messages sent from the Inbox.

---

## Getting Started

1. Log in at [**zapier.com**](zapier.com).
2. Search for **MessageDesk** in the app directory.
3. Connect your MessageDesk account when prompted.
4. Build a Zap using one of our **triggers** and/or **actions** above.

---

## Common Recipes (Copy These Ideas)

- **CRM → MessageDesk:** When a lead is created, or a form is submitted → **Create/Update contact** → **Send message** (“Thanks for reaching out! Reply STOP to opt out.”)
- **MessageDesk → Slack:** **Message received** → Post the message and link to the thread in a team channel.
- **MessageDesk → Google Sheets:** **Message sent** → Append a row with `timestamp`, `to`, `from`, `message_body`, `status`.
- **Scheduling tool → MessageDesk:** Upcoming appointment in Calendly/Google Calendar → **Send message** reminder 24 hours before.

---

## Best Practices

- **Stay compliant:** Include opt-out language when appropriate (e.g., “Reply **STOP** to opt out”). Ensure **A2P 10DLC / Toll-Free verification** is complete before automating sends to US numbers.
- **Use E.164 formatting:** `+15551234567` for phone numbers to avoid failures.
- **Test with real data:** Run Zapier’s **Test** step and check the message in your MessageDesk thread.
- **Handle errors:** Add a Zapier step for **Paths/Filters** or **Error handling** (e.g., only send if a phone number is present).
- **Avoid blasting via Zapier:** For large sends, use MessageDesk **broadcasts**; Zapier actions send **one message per Zap run**.

## Troubleshooting

**Auth fails when connecting to MessageDesk**

- Reconnect the app in Zapier; ensure you’re logged into the correct workspace in MessageDesk and that your role has access.

**Action ‘Send message’ succeeds, but the delivery fails**

- Open the thread in MessageDesk and review **Delivery Status & Errors**. Check registration status, number formatting, content filters, and media size.

**Missing or incorrect contact data**

- Confirm Zap field mapping. Ensure custom fields exist in MessageDesk and types match.

**Zaps not triggering on inbound messages**

- Verify the trigger is **Message received** and that the workspace/line receiving the message matches the connected account. Send a fresh test message to fire the trigger.
