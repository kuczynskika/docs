# 30-Day Free Trial Overview

MessageDesk offers a free forever seat as well as a 30-day free trial period to help you evaluate the platform before committing to a paid plan.

## Individual Plan - Free Forever Details

We don't ask for a credit card to create a MessageDesk account. Instead, when you create your MessageDesk account, you're on a free forever [**Individual Plan**](/resources/pricing).

- **Duration:** forever.
- **Start date:** begins when you create your free MessageDesk account.

## 30-Day Free Trial Details

Your 30-day free trial begins when you enter a credit card. We ask for a credit card in two places in-app:

1. When adding **teammates**
2. When connecting new or existing **phone lines** to MessageDesk

<Note>
  **Note:** Twilio users connecting their Twilio numbers to MessageDesk are exempt from [carrier registration](/a2p-registration/a2p-overview) and may connect phone numbers to MessageDesk without adding a payment method or starting a trial.
</Note>
