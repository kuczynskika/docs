# 30-Day Free Trial Overview

You can explore MessageDesk in two ways:

- **Individual (Free Forever)** – no credit card required.
- **30-Day Free Trial** – unlocks team features and more after you add a payment method and select a plan.

---

## TL;DR

- **Create an account:** You start on the **Individual (Free Forever)** plan — **no credit card** needed.
- **Start a trial:** Your **30-day trial** begins **only after** you **enter a credit card and select a plan** (usually when **adding teammates** or **connecting phone lines**).
- **Messaging during trial:** Works after **carrier registration** is complete.
- **At day 30:** Billing **begins on the plan you selected** unless you **cancel** before the trial ends.

<Note>
  **Twilio users:** If you connect existing **Twilio** numbers, you're exempt from carrier registration inside MessageDesk and can connect numbers **without starting a trial** or adding a payment method.
</Note>

## Individual plan — free forever

- **Duration:** Forever
- **Starts:** As soon as you create your MessageDesk account
- **Best for:** Viewing MessageDesk solo before inviting a team or connecting lines
