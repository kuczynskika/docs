# MessageDesk Compliance Center

Set how your workspace handles SMS opt-outs, opt-out confirmations, signatures, and STOP keywords—clearly and carrier-friendly.

---

## How to Access the Compliance Center

Go to **Account → Settings → Compliance Center** (under **Workspace Settings**).

<Note>
  **Note:** If you don’t see Compliance Center, your role may not include access. Ask an Admin or Manager.

## SMS Compliance Overview

The **Overview** tab explains U.S. SMS compliance basics and recommended practices.

By Law, when sending business text messages in the United States, you must follow these guidelines:

1. Do not send any SHAFT-C-related content.
2. Only message contacts who have opted in to receive messaging from you.
3. Respect opt-out: when contacts reply "STOP" you should not send any additional messages.
4. Do not send messages outside of normal business hours.

## How MessageDesk Helps Keep You Compliant

MessageDesk automatically enforces:

1. "Reply STOP to opt-out" for all contacts who reply STOP at any time.
2. Tracking opt-outs for each number across your entire workspace.
3. When contacts opt out of messaging, MessageDesk automatically tracks this for you.

## Opt-Out Configuration

MessageDesk gives you two options for configuring opt-out.

### 1. Inbox Opt-Out (carrier-preferred)

If a contact opts out on **one** phone number, they are blocked from **all** numbers in your workspace.

**When to use:** This works best for most teams—single standard, fewer compliance mistakes, can result in better deliverability.

### 2. Phone Number Opt-Out

If a contact opts out of messaging from **one** number, they can still receive texts from **other** numbers in your workspace.

**When to use:** Each number serves a distinct audience or purpose (with separate consent).

## Opt-Out Confirmation

Opt-out confirmation sends a mesages confirming that they've opted out of messaging. You can fine tune what the contact sees immediately after they unsubscribe.

**What happens by default**

- MessageDesk sends an **automatic confirmation** acknowledging the opt-out.
- The conversation shows an **opt-out banner**, and future sends are blocked.

**Edit the opt out confirmation:**

1. Click **Edit**

- Edit the message to include a confirmation that the contact has opted out as well as a brief note about how to **opt back in** (see “Re-opt in” below).

## Opt-Out Signature

Add a standard opt-out line (e.g., **“Reply STOP to opt out.”**) to all sent messages. This improves clarity and can help you meet carrier expectations.

**Options:**

- **Apply to all sent messages (carrier-preferred)** — Most compliant; least confusing for recipients.
- **Include once per conversation** — Adds the signature only to the first outbound message in a thread.

**How to set:** **Settings → Compliance Center → Opt-Out → Signature**.

**Tips:**

- Keep it short and standard: **“Reply STOP to opt out.”**
- Pair with your business/organization name when appropriate for context.

## STOP Keywords

MessageDesk automatically manages opt-outs when a contact replies with a supported keyword:

- `stop`
- `unsubscribe`

<Note>
  **Note:** Variations (case/spacing) are supported.
</Note>

**What you’ll see**

- The contact receives an **automatic confirmation**.
- You’ll see an **opt-out notice** in the thread.
- Future sends are **blocked** based on your configured scope.

## Opt-Out Best Practices

- **Message only opted-in contacts.**
- **Respect opt-outs immediately.** Don’t follow with a “last message.”
- **Include opt-out language** (signature) on non-conversational sends.
- **Avoid spam triggers** (generic short links, all caps, excessive punctuation).
- **Send during business hours** when possible.

## Troubleshooting

**I can’t text a contact anymore.**\
They may be opted out. Check the **opt-out banner** in the thread and review **scope** in Compliance Center.

**Switching numbers didn’t bypass an opt-out.**\
You likely have **Inbox Opt-Out** enabled. Change to **Phone Number Opt-Out** only if your compliance policy allows distinct consent per line.

**A contact wants to opt back in.**\
Ask them to send **START** (or another explicit consent message) from the same number. Then confirm opt-in and resume messaging per your policy.

**Our messages are being filtered.**\
Enable the **opt-out signature** for clarity, review content for potential spam triggers, and confirm your **carrier registration** status for each line.
