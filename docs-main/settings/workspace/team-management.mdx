# Team Management: Invite Teammates & Set Roles with Permissions

Get your team on board fast, then control who can see, edit, and delete what—without slowing anyone down.

---

## TL;DR

- **Invite teammates:** **Settings → Team Management → Invite Teammate**
- **Accept invite:** Teammate creates an account with the **same email** from the invite
- **Access:** Use **Roles** (Admin/Manager/Operator/Custom) + **feature permissions**
- **Permission levels:** **Owner** (view/edit/delete), **Editor** (view/edit), **Viewer** (view), **No Access** (blocked)

---

## How to invite & manage teammates

### Invite teammates

1. Go to **Settings** → click your profile image (top right).
2. Open **Team Management** under **Workspace Settings**.\\

   <Note>

   </Note>
3. Click **Invite Teammate** → enter one or more **email addresses** → select a **Role** → **Send**.

Permissions allow a user to create, read, update, and delete information in MessageDesk. MessageDesk offers four distinct permission levels: **Owner**, **Editor**, **Viewer**, and **No Access**.

## Custom Roles & Permissions

Here's how to create custom roles for users within your workspace.

### How to create a custom role

1. **Account → Settings → Team Management**
2. Click **Create new role** → name it → (optional).

<Tip>
  **Tip:** Use **Copy permissions from an existing role** as a starting point.
</Tip>

![Roles Permissions Name Copy Pn](/docs-main/images/roles-permissions-name-copy.png)

3. Set per-feature access (**Owner / Editor / Viewer / No Access**).
4. Adjust **feature** access for specific **Phone Lines**, **Labels**, **Teammate** Inboxes, and other **Workspace Settings**.

<Tip>
  **Tip:** Uncheck **Select all** to grant/remove access to **specific** phone lines, labels, or teammate inboxes.
</Tip>

![Roles Permissions Select Access Pn](/docs-main/images/roles-permissions-select-access.png)

5. **Save changes** and apply your new role to teammates.

## Frequently asked questions

**I invited the wrong email. What now?**\
Remove the pending invite from **Team Management** and send a new invite to the correct email.

**Unlimited teammates and roles?**\
Yes. You can invite unlimited teammates and create unlimited custom roles. Each teammate counts as a **seat**.

**Role vs. Permission?**\
A **Role** is a collection of **Permissions**. A **Permission** is the access level for a specific feature or resource.

**Can I delete a custom role?**\
Not yet—role deletion isn't supported (updates planned). You can edit or stop assigning it.

**Can Managers delete things?**\
No. **The editor** cannot delete. Only the **Owner** can delete.

**Limit someone to one phone line?**\
Grant **Editor** on that **Phone Number** and set others to **Viewer/No Access**.

**Can I use phone line extension numbers with MessageDesk?**\
MessageDesk does not directly integrate with or support texting for phone line extension numbers. However, you can configure **user Roles and Permissions** to limit access to certain phone lines. Additionally, you can use **conversation assignment** and **Relays** to automate who gets assigned to what conversation on any given phone line.

**See a conversation without line/label access?**\
Yes—**assignment** to the conversation grants **Editor** on that thread.

**Restrict to certain labels (e.g., Support: Urgent)?**\
Grant **Editor** on that label; set others to **Viewer/No Access**.

**Do changes apply immediately?**\
Yes—have users **refresh** to see the updated UI.

**Who can access Relays by default?**\
Only **Admin** users have access to Relays by default. Admins can grant **Relay Management** permissions to other roles via custom role configuration. Learn more: [Relays Overview](/relays/overview).

## Troubleshooting

**Invite not received**

- Check **spam/junk** and verify the **email address**.
- Resend: **Team Management → ⋯ → Resend Invitation**.
- Still missing? Ask IT to allowlist `messagedesk.com` and try again.

**User can't see Team Management**

- Their role likely has **Viewer/No Access** for **Team Management**. An **Admin** or **Manager** (Editor) must adjust.

**User can't see Relays**

- By default, only **Admin** users have access to Relays. An **Admin** must grant **Relay Management** permissions to the user's role via custom role configuration.

**Buttons are greyed out**

- The user is likely a **Viewer** on that feature, or the action requires **Owner**. Hover for the tooltip; upgrade access if appropriate.

**User sees conversations they shouldn't**

- Check for **assignment** (assignment grants Editor).
- Review **resource-level** permissions (wildcards `*` on Labels or Phone Numbers).
- Remove any **user override** that elevates access.

**Role changes didn't "stick"**

- Ask the user to **refresh**.
- Confirm there isn't a conflicting **override** or **resource-level** restriction.

---

## Team management best practices

- **Least privilege first:** Start with **Operator**, elevate only as needed.
- **Prefer roles over overrides:** Keep exceptions rare and documented.
- **Mirror your routing:** If you route by **phone line** or **label**, set permissions the same way.
- **Quarterly audits:** Review who has **Owner** on **Billing**, **Phone Numbers**, and **Team Management**.
- **Onboarding checklist:** Invite → assign role → confirm resource-level access → share key labels/lines → verify login.
- **Offboarding checklist:** Remove member → reassign conversations → review resource permissions → audit roles.
