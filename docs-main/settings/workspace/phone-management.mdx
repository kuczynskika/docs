# How to Manage Connected Phone Lines + Naming/Organization

Connect new phone lines, rename existing ones (with emojis for easy ID), and keep everything organized for your team.

---

## Navigate to Phone Management

1. Go to **Account → Settings → Workspace Settings → Phone Management**
2. You’ll see all connected phone lines with options to **Add**, **Edit**, and manage registration status.

> **Permissions:** You’ll need the proper role to manage numbers (e.g., **Manager = Editor**, **Operator = Viewer** by default). See **Roles & permissions** if you don’t see controls.

## How to Add a New Phone Line / Number to MessageDesk

1. In **Phone Management** in **Workspace Settings,** click **\+ Add phone number**
2. Choose the type you want to connect or purchase:

- [**Overview (connecting phone lines)**](/get-started/phone-numbers/overview)
- [**Purchase a new text-only local number**](/get-started/phone-numbers/purchase-new)
- [**Host your existing Landline/VoIP**](/get-started/phone-numbers/landline-voip)
- [**Toll-Free (text-enabled)**](/get-started/phone-numbers/toll-free)
- [**Connect Twilio phone numbers**](/get-started/phone-numbers/twilio)

<Warning>
  To add additional non-Twilio phone lines, complete [**Carrier Registration**](/a2p-registration/a2p-overview) first (10DLC for local, verification for toll-free).
</Warning>

<Note>
  **Twilio users:** If you connect existing Twilio numbers, you can attach them without starting a MessageDesk trial or adding a payment method.
</Note>

## How to Name/Label Phone Lines (and Add Emojis)

Clear names make routing and triage faster—especially with multiple lines.

1. Go to **Settings → Phone Management**
2. Click **Edit** next to a phone line
3. Enter a **Line name** (e.g., “Support – West” or “Dispatch 🚚”)
4. (Optional) Add an **emoji** for quick visual scanning in the Inbox
5. Click **Update**

## Best practices

- **Use a naming pattern:** `Team – Region` (e.g., “Sales – East”), or `Use-case` (e.g., “Reminders 📅”).
- **One line per purpose:** Keep support, sales, and dispatch on their own lines for cleaner reporting and routing.
- **Complete carrier registration:** Complete **10DLC** (local) or **toll-free verification** before sending messages or connecting phone lines.

## Frequently Asked Phone Number Management Questions

**How many phone lines can I connect?**\
Most workspaces can connect up to 48 phone lines to MessageDesk (many teams operate with several). If you plan to scale, contact support for guidance.

**Can I move a conversation to a different phone line?**\
Conversations live on the line where they started. For new outreach, compose from the desired line.

**Do I need carrier registration for each line?**\
No—you can apply one carrier registration to **all of your connected phone lines**. However, toll-free and Twilio-connected phone lines require separate **carrier registration and verification**.

**Who can add or edit lines?**\
Users with **Phone Numbers = Editor** permission (typically **Managers** or **Admins**).
