# Data Center

The **Data Center** is your hub for importing data into MessageDesk—starting with **contacts** and **historical messages**. Upload a CSV, map fields, resolve duplicates, and monitor progress in one place.

---

## Access the Data Center

Go to **Account → Settings → Data Center** (under **Workspace Settings**).

<Note>
  **Don’t see Data Center?** Your role may not include access. Ask an Admin or Manager to adjust your permissions.

## How to Import Contacts

Quickly build your contact list by uploading a **CSV** and mapping it to MessageDesk fields.

### Start an import

1. Open **Settings → Data Center**.
2. Click **Start Import**.
3. Choose your **.csv** file and upload.

### Map your columns

- Columns that match MessageDesk field names **auto-map**.
- Adjust mapping manually as needed.
- You can map **custom properties** (ensure the CSV data type matches the property type).

### Review duplicates & errors

- **Duplicates** (by **email** or **phone**) are flagged—choose to **skip** or update.
- **Invalid data** (e.g., bad phone/email format) is reported so you can fix and re-upload.
- Problem rows are **skipped** during processing.

### Monitor progress

After you start the import, you’ll see the real-time status. When complete, a summary shows total **processed**, **imported**, **skipped**, and any **error reasons**.

## How to Import Messages

Preserve conversation context by importing **past SMS** from any platform or service into MessageDesk.

### Start a message import

1. Open **Settings → Data Center**.
2. Click **Start Import**.
3. Upload your **.csv** file.

### Map your data

- Map CSV columns to MessageDesk **message fields** (e.g., timestamp, direction, phone number, text, channel/line).
- Review and confirm the mapping for accuracy.

### Validate, review, and import

- Preview parsed messages and fix any errors the validator surfaces.
- Click **Import** to start processing. A bottom banner shows pre-import issues (if any).

### Supported message types

- **Outbound (sent)** messages
- **Inbound (received)** messages
- **1-on-1** conversations
- **Group** conversations

<Warning>
  **Note: Not supported for message import:** media attachments (images, videos, files) and internal comments.
</Warning>

### How message import works

- **Automatic conversation creation:** If a conversation doesn’t exist for a row, MessageDesk creates it.
- **Existing conversations:** Rows match into existing threads when possible.
- **Channel requirement:** Messages can only be imported into **outbound channels that already exist** in your workspace.

## Frequently Asked Data Import Questions

### What file types can I upload?

**CSV only.** Export Excel files (`.xlsx`) to CSV first.

### Do contacts need both email and phone?

No. Each row must include **at least one**: **email** _or_ **phone** (you can include both).

### How are duplicates handled on contact import?

We check **email** and **phone**. Duplicates are **skipped** by default and listed in the results.

### Why did some rows fail?

Common reasons: invalid email/phone format, missing required fields, custom property type mismatch, or a channel that doesn’t exist (for message imports). Fix and re-upload.

### Can I import more than 5,000 rows?

Split your data into multiple CSV files. Each file can contain **up to 5,000 rows** and **≤ 10 MB**.

### Can I import from mobile?

No. Imports are **web-only**. Use a desktop browser.

## Best practices

- **Normalize phone numbers** to **E.164** before upload.
- **Clean your data** (dedupe, validate emails) to minimize skips.
- **Test with a small CSV** (10–20 rows) to confirm mapping and validation.
- Keep a **backup** of your source CSV and **import results** for audit.
