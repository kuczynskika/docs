# Data Center

The **Data Center** is your hub for importing data into MessageDesk—starting with **contacts**. Use it to upload a CSV, map fields, resolve duplicates, and monitor import progress.

---

## Access the Data Center

Go to **Account → Settings → Data Center** (under **Workspace Settings**).

<Note>
  **Note:** Don’t see **Data Center**? Your role may not include access. Ask an Admin or Manager to adjust your permissions.

## Contact Import

Quickly build your contact list by uploading a **CSV** and mapping it to MessageDesk fields.

### Start an import

1. Open **Settings → Data Center**.
2. Click **Import Contacts**.
3. Choose your **.csv** file and upload.

### Map your columns

- Columns with names that match MessageDesk fields will **auto-map**.
- Adjust any field mapping manually.
- You can include **custom properties** (make sure the data type matches your property definition).

### Review duplicates & errors

MessageDesk validates your file before import:

- **Duplicates** (by email or phone) are flagged—choose to **skip** or update.
- **Invalid data** (e.g., bad phone/email format) is reported so you can fix and re-upload.
- Rows with issues are **skipped** during processing.

### Monitor progress

After you start the import, you’ll see real-time status. When complete, a summary shows total **processed**, **imported**, **skipped**, and any **error reasons**.

## FAQs

## Best Practices

- **Normalize phone numbers** to **E.164** before upload.
- **Clean your data** (dedupe, validate emails) to minimize skips.
- **Test with a small CSV** (e.g., 10 rows) to confirm mapping and validation.
- Keep a **backup of your source CSV** and the **import results** for audit.
