# User Roles & Permissions in MessageDesk

A clear access model keeps your Inbox safe and your team fast.\
Use **roles** for broad access. Refine with **resource-level permissions** and **user overrides** when needed.

---

## TL;DR (the big picture)

- **Permission levels:** **Owner** (view/edit/delete), **Editor** (view/edit), **Viewer** (view), **Blocked** (no access)
- **Default roles:** **Admin**, **Manager**, **Operator**
- **Final access = highest rule** across **role**, **resource permissions** (phone lines, labels, teammates), **user overrides**, and **assignee status**
- **Best practice:** Start with **Operator**, elevate sparingly, and audit quarterly

<Info>
  **Precedence:** User overrides Role permissions. If nothing matches, access defaults to **Blocked**.
</Info>

---

## What Each Permission Level Allows

| Level       | View | Create/Edit | Delete | Typical use     |
| ----------- | ---- | ----------: | -----: | --------------- |
| **Owner**   | ✅    | ✅           | ✅      | Full control    |
| **Editor**  | ✅    | ✅           | ❌      | Day-to-day work |
| **Viewer**  | ✅    | ❌           | ❌      | Read-only       |
| **Blocked** | ❌    | ❌           | ❌      | No access       |

## Default User Roles

Use these user roles out of the box with MessageDesk or copy them as a base to create new custom roles with new permission levels.

### **Admin** — full access

- All features & resources, including account and billing: **Owner**
- Cannot be removed from the workspace by Managers or Operators

### **Manager** — intermediate access

- Most features: **Editor**
- **Billing**, **Workspace Profile**, **Workspace Settings**: **Viewer**
- **Team Management**, **Phone Numbers**: **Editor**

### **Operator** — frontline access

- **Contacts**, **Contact Properties**, **Labels**, **Message Templates**: **Editor**
- Everything else: **Viewer**

<Note>
  You can create **custom roles** to fit your exact workflow.

## Resource-level permissions (fine-grained control)

Grant access to **specific items** instead of an entire feature:

- **Phone Numbers**: by channel ID, supports wildcard `*`
- **Labels**: by label ID, supports wildcard `*`
- **Teammates**: by user ID, supports wildcard `*`

Use these to:

- Limit a teammate to one phone line
- Allow work on only “Support: Urgent” conversations
- Share just one person’s assigned queue for coverage

## Manage User Access (how to make changes)

### Grant and revoke access (custom roles)

Create custom roles to grant or revoke access to **teammates' inboxes**, **phone numbers**, and **labels**.

## User Role Permissions Explained (deeper detail)

Permissions fall into two groups:

- **Inbox access** — what conversations a user can see/work on
- **Workspace access** — what features and settings a user can view/edit/delete

### Inbox access (three sources)

1. **Phone Number inboxes** — conversations on specific outbound channels
2. **Label inboxes** — conversations tagged with specific labels
3. **Teammate inboxes** — conversations assigned to a specific teammate

Grant per item or use **All** for broad access.

<Note>
  In the example below, this role grants **no access** to labels, phone numbers, or teammate inboxes.\
  Users with this role will **only** see conversations if they are **assigned** to them.
</Note>

<Info>
  Teammates always have **Editor** access to conversations **assigned** to them.
</Info>

### Workspace access (features & settings)

Decide who can open, change, or delete workspace-level areas.

## Frequently Asked User Roles and Permissions Questions

**What’s the difference between a role and a user override?**\
A **role** sets the baseline. A **user override** changes access for a single person without changing the role for everyone else. Overrides take precedence.

**Can Managers delete things?**\
No. **The editor** cannot delete. Only the **Owner** can delete.

**How do I let someone work only one phone line?**\
Use **resource-level permissions**: set **Outbound Channel → that line = Editor**, others Viewer/Blocked.

**Can a user see a conversation if they’re not granted line/label access?**\
Yes, if they are **assigned** to that conversation—assignment grants **Editor** on that thread.

**Can I restrict access by label (e.g., Support: Urgent only)?**\
Yes. Grant **Editor** on that **Label** and set other labels to Viewer/Blocked.

**Why does a user still see controls disabled even after I changed their role?**\
They may have a **Viewer** on the feature or a **resource restriction** that lowers access. Check user overrides and resource permissions; the highest level wins.

**Can I hide Team Management from Operators?**\
Yes. Leave **Team Management** as **Viewer** (default) or set **Blocked** via an override.

**Do changes apply immediately?**\
Yes, but users may need to **refresh** the app to see updated UI states.

**Can I export a list of who has which permissions?** Use your **Team Management** view to review roles; document user overrides for audit. (If you need exports, contact support.)

---

## Troubleshooting

**I can’t change a teammate’s role.**\
You likely lack access to **Team Management** (Viewer/Blocked). Ask an **Admin** or **Manager** (Editor on Team Management) to update roles.

**A user can see conversations they shouldn’t.**\
Check for:

- **Assignment** to those conversations (assignment grants Editor)
- A wildcard (`*`) **Label** or **Channel** permission that’s too broad
- A **user override** elevating access

**The operator permission can’t send broadcasts.**\
By default, Operators are **Viewers** on **Broadcasts**. Add a **user override** or create a **custom role** with **Editor** for Broadcasts.

**User can’t purchase numbers or manage TCR.**\
They need **Phone Numbers = Editor** (Managers default to Editor; Operators default to Viewer).

**Buttons are greyed out.**\
Hover for a tooltip. Most often, the user is a **Viewer** on that feature or an **Editor** when an **Owner** action (delete) is required.

**Relays aren’t visible.**\
Relays are not yet available to standard workspaces.

**Changes not showing up.**\
Have the user refresh. If still off, re-check **overrides** and **resource permissions** (labels, channels, teammates).

---

## Best practices

- **Least privilege first.** Start with **Operator**, elevate as needed.
- **Prefer roles over overrides.** Keep exceptions rare and documented.
- **Audit quarterly.** Review who has **Owner** on **Billing**, **Phone Numbers**, **Team Management**.
- **Mirror routing.** If you work by label or line, align permissions the same way.
- **Assign conversations.** Ownership grants **Editor** and prevents double work.
