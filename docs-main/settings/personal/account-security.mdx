## Security Best Practices

- **Use a unique password** – Don't reuse passwords from other accounts (MessageDesk enforces this by preventing reuse of your last 8 passwords)
- **Keep codes private** – Never share your verification code with anyone
- **Act promptly** – Complete the reset process soon after receiving the code
- **Report suspicious activity** – If you didn't request a reset, contact support immediately
- **Use a password manager** – Consider using one to generate and store strong passwords
- **Enable two-factor authentication** – Add your cell phone in your profile settings for extra security

<Warning>
  Resetting your password will require you to sign in again on all other devices with your new password.
</Warning>
