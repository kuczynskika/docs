# How to Manage Personal Notification Preferences

Decide when MessageDesk should ping you—and on which devices—so you never miss the messages that matter.

---

## TL;DR

- Open **Account → Settings → Notification Preferences (My Settings)** to pick your **email** notification rule.
- Install the **mobile app** for **push** alerts.
- Enable **browser** notifications in **Chrome** or the **installed app** (Chrome App or Safari App).

---

## What MessageDesk Can Notify You About

- **Email**
- **Mobile push** (iOS & Android)
- **Browser notifications**
  - **Chrome (browser tab)**
  - **Chrome App** (installed PWA)
  - **Safari App** on macOS Sonoma+

<Note>
  **Note:** You control each channel independently. For example, you can keep **email** off and **mobile push** on.
</Note>

## Configure Email Notifications

1. In MessageDesk, go to **Account → Settings → Notification Preferences (My Settings)**.
2. Choose one:
   - **Notify me about every new message** – emails for all inbound conversations in your workspace.
   - **Only notify me about conversations assigned to me** – emails only when there’s activity in threads you’re assigned to.
   - **Don’t send me notifications** – turns off email notifications.
3. Click **Save Changes**

## Notifications Tips & Best Practices

- **Pick one or two primary channels.** To reduce noise, keep either **mobile push** or **browser** as your main real-time channel and rely on **email** as a backup.
- **Use “Assigned to me”** if you only want alerts for threads you own.
- **Respect Focus / DND.** iOS/Android Focus modes and macOS/Windows **Do Not Disturb** can silence MessageDesk—check these if alerts seem quiet.
- **Stay signed in.** Push and browser notifications require an active login on that device.
- **Test quickly.** Assign a conversation to yourself and send a message to confirm that the device receives alerts.

## Troubleshooting

**I’m not getting any notifications.**

- Confirm the setting in **Account → Settings → Notification Preferences**.
- Ensure you’re **signed in** on the device.
- Check OS settings (iOS/Android/macOS/Windows) to verify that **Notifications are allowed** for MessageDesk.
- Turn off **Do Not Disturb / Focus** or add MessageDesk as an allowed app.

**Email notifications aren’t arriving.**

- Check spam/junk and allowlist `messagedesk.com`.
- Verify your **email address** in **Account → Settings → Profile**.
- If using “Assigned to me,” make sure the conversation is **assigned to you**.

**Chrome isn’t showing notifications.**

- In the address bar, click the **site settings** icon → set **Notifications: Allow**.
- Ensure **System → Notifications** (Windows/macOS) allows Chrome notifications.
- Keep at least one **MessageDesk tab** open or use the **installed app**.

**Mobile push is inconsistent.**

- Make sure Background App Refresh (iOS) / unrestricted battery (Android) is enabled for MessageDesk.
- Log out and back in to refresh the device token.

## Frequently Asked Notifications Questions

**If I set “Don’t send me notifications,” does that affect other users?**\
No. Notification preferences are **per user**.

**Do I need both browser and mobile push?**\
No. Choose the channel that fits your workflow. Many users keep **mobile push on** and **email off**.

**Will I get duplicate notifications?**\
If you enable multiple channels, you may get duplicates (e.g., email + mobile). Fine-tune by turning one off.

**Do closed conversations notify me?**\
Notifications follow your personal rule (e.g., “Assigned to me”). If a closed thread reopens and you’re assigned, you may receive alerts again.
