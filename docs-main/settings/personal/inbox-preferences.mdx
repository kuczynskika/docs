# Customize Your Inbox: Theme, Layout & Personal Signature

Make your inbox easier to read, faster to navigate, and on-brand—without affecting anyone else on your team.

<Note>
  **Mobile users:** On mobile, you can only change the color theme. Layout and signature settings are desktop-only.
</Note>

## Change Your Inbox Appearance (Theme & Color)

### 1) Go to **Account → Settings → Inbox Preferences (My Settings)**

Open the **Appearance** tab.

### 2) Pick a **Color Theme**

Choose a preset palette or use the color picker for a custom accent.

### 3) Choose a **mode**

- **Light mode** — light UI using your selected color palette
- **Dark mode** — dark UI using your selected color palette
- **System mode** — follows your device’s appearance; if your device switches by time of day, MessageDesk follows

## Organize Your Inbox Layout (What You See in the Left Nav)

You control which **phone lines**, **teammate inboxes**, and **labels** appear—and in what order.

### 1) Go to **Account → Settings → Inbox Preferences (My Settings)**

Open the **Layout** tab to view your current configuration.

### 2) Pin, unpin, and reorder

- **Pin / Unpin** items to show or hide them
- **Drag & drop** to reorder sections and items
- Click **Save changes** when you’re done

<Note>
  Your layout changes are **personal**. Pinning/unpinning and reordering only affect your view—not your teammates’.

## Create & Edit Your Personal Text Message Signature

Add a short sign-off that auto-appends to your outbound texts from your user profile.

### 1. Go to **Account → Settings → Inbox Preferences (My Settings)**

Open the **Personal Signature** tab.

### 2. Toggle **Apply personal signature** ON

This enables your signature.

### 3. Click the **pencil** icon to edit your signature

By default, MessageDesk uses **tags** like:

- `{{ UserFirstName }}` — your user first name
- `{{ WorkspaceName }}` — your workspace name

You can edit the text and mix in other [tags](/messaging/templates-tags) as needed.

<Warning>
  Make sure your **User First Name** and **Workspace Name** are set in MessageDesk before enabling signatures. Missing values can cause unexpected signature text.
</Warning>

### 4. Choose when the signature applies

- **Apply signature to all sent messages** — appends to every message you send
- **Only apply to first ever sent message in conversation** — appends only to your first outbound in a thread

## Language Localization

MessageDesk does not currently support native language localization or translation features. However, you can use third-party browser extensions to translate the interface and messages into your preferred language.

### Using browser translation tools

Most modern browsers offer built-in or extension-based translation:

- **Google Chrome** — Use the built-in Google Translate feature or install the [Google Translate extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-translate/aapbdbdomjkkjkaonfhkkikfgjllcleb)
- **Microsoft Edge** — Built-in Microsoft Translator
- **Firefox** — Install translation extensions like [To Google Translate](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/to-google-translate/)
- **Safari** — Use the built-in translation feature (macOS Monterey and later)

These tools can translate both the MessageDesk interface and message content in real-time.

<Note>
  Third-party translation tools are not affiliated with MessageDesk. Translation accuracy and privacy policies are managed by the extension provider.
