### 2. Update your Inbox Appearance

MessageDesk allows you to set:

- **Light mode** (a light color design tied to your color palette selection)
- **Dark mode **(a dark color design tied to your color palette selection)
- **System mode** (a time-of-day color design tied to your color palette selection)

## How to Organize the Layout of Your Inbox

<Note>
  Changing the order of any/all of these elements will only apply to your user view. Unpinning or reorganizing your inbox layout will not affect other users' views in your workspace.

## How to create and edit your personal text message signature

You can create and append a personal signature to all text messages sent from your user profile. Here's how:

### 1. Navigate to Account  \> Settings  \>  Inbox Preferences (My Settings)

Click on the Personal Signature tab to view your current signature configuration

### 2. Click "Apply personal signature" to turn on the signature feature

### 3. Click on the pencil icon to edit your signature

By default, MessageDesk uses the **{{ UserFirstName }}** and **{{ WorkspaceName }}** tags as the content for your signature. You can edit this text to your liking.

Both tags auto-fill with whatever your user's first name and workspace name are set to in MessageDesk. 

<Warning>
  **Warning:** Not setting a first name for your user profile or a name for your workspace may result in unexpected signature behavior. Be sure both are set in MessageDesk before you turn on the user signature feature.
</Warning>

### 4. Set Signature Settings

Message signatures currently have two settings:

1. **Apply signature to all sent messages**

   (Applies your signature to every message you send from MessageDesk)
2. **Only apply to first ever send message in conversation**

   (Only applies your signature to the first ever sent message in that conversation/text thread)
