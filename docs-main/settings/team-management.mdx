## Accepting an Invitation

When a teammate is invited, they'll receive an email from MessageDesk. This email will route them to `inbox.messagedesk.com/#/create-account`

To accept their invitation, they just need to create an account with the same email address they were invited with.

Upon account creation, they'll be automatically added to any inboxes they've been invited to.

## Teammate Roles & Permissions

### Default Roles:

By default, each inbox comes with 3 roles:

1. **Admin: **full access to the inbox, all phone numbers and all conversations. Full account level access for billing, teammates and phone number management. They can create, edit and delete anything in MessageDesk.
2. **Manager**: Full access to the inbox, all phone numbers and all conversations. Full access to team management (invite and remove teammates) and phone management (add/remove phone numbers). **_Read-only access to account information like billing & workspace details. _**
3. **Operator:** Full access to the inbox, all phone numbers and all conversations. View only access to workspace information, team management and phone management.

You can also create custom roles with custom permissions. This is how you can customize which teammates have access to which conversations or features within the Inbox.

## Role Permissions Explained

Each role has a series of "Permissions". Permissions are organized into 2 categories:

- **Inbox Access**: Controls what conversations the teammate has access to
- **Workspace Access**: Controls the feature access & configuration access for the teammate.

### Inbox Access

MessageDesk supports 3 types of inboxes:

1. Phone Number Inboxes: Conversations with a specific phone number.
2. Label Inboxes: Conversations labeled with a specific label. 
3. Teammate Inboxes: Conversations assigned to a specific teammate.

Each Role can grant access to phone numbers, labels and teammate inboxes individually. Or you can set a role to grant access to all labels, all phone numbers, all teammates. 

<Note>
  In the example below, this Role grants **no access** to any label, phone number or teammate. Users with this role will only see conversations if they are assigned to them.
</Note>

<Info>
  Teammates always have access to conversation assigned directly to them
</Info>

### Workspace Permissions

Workspace permissions determine what settings each teammate has access to. By default, all teammates have access to "my settings".

![CleanShot 2025-08-26 at 12.03.35.png](/images/CleanShot2025-08-26at12.03.35.png)

But Workspace Access lets you control who has access to each workspace setting.
