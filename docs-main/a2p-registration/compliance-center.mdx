### **1) Opt‑Out Configuration**

Choose how broadly an opt‑out applies:

- **Inbox Opt‑Out (Carrier Preferred):**\
  If a contact opts out from one phone number, they’re blocked from all numbers in your inbox. Best for most teams to maximize deliverability and compliance.
- **Phone Number Opt‑Out:**\
  If a contact opts out from one number, you can still message them from other numbers in your workspace.

When to use:

- Pick **Inbox Opt‑Out** if you use multiple numbers but want a single compliance standard across the business.
- Pick **Phone Number Opt‑Out** if each number serves a distinct, independently consented audience.

How to set:

1. Go to Settings \> Compliance Center.
2. Open the Opt‑Out tab.
3. Select your preferred opt‑out scope.

### **2) Opt‑Out Signature**

Adds a clear opt‑out line (e.g., “Reply STOP to opt‑out”) to your sent messages. Including the opt-out signature will improve deliverability by meeting carrier expectations.

Options:

- **Apply to all sent messages (Carrier Preferred):**\
  Adds the signature to every message. Highest clarity and best for compliance.
- **Include once per conversation:**\
  Adds the signature only to the first message your team sends to a conversation.

How to set:

1. Settings \> Compliance Center \> Opt‑Out.
2. Choose signature behavior (all messages or once per conversation).

Tip:

- Keep the language short and standard: “Reply STOP to opt‑out.”

### **3) STOP Keywords**

MessageDesk automatically manages SMS unsubscribes for you. Contact can opt-out (unsubscribe) by replying to with the following keywords:

- "Stop"
- unsubscribe

\*\*Note: \*\*all variations of the above are supported: capitalized, lowercase, etc.

<Info>
  **What happens when a contact replies with a STOP keyword?**

  - The contact receives an automatic confirmation.
  - You’ll see an opt‑out notice in the conversation.
  - Future sends to that contact are blocked according to your selected scope.
</Info>

## **How MessageDesk Keeps You Compliant**

- Auto‑replies with “STOP” confirmation.
- Prevents sending to opted‑out contacts based on your scope (Inbox or Phone Number).
- Tracks and enforces opt‑outs automatically across your workspace.
- Encourages standard language to maintain carrier deliverability.

### **Best Practices**

- Only message contacts who have opted in.
- Respect opt‑out immediately—do not send additional messages.
- Include clear opt‑out language (signature) to reduce filtering.
- Send during normal business hours.

### **Troubleshooting SMS Compliance Issues**

- Can’t send to a contact?\
  They may be opted out. Check the banner in the conversation or the Compliance Center settings.
- Using multiple numbers?\
  If you selected **Inbox Opt‑Out**, switching numbers won’t bypass the opt‑out.
- Contact wants back in?\
  Follow the instructions shown in the opt‑out confirmation message in the thread to restart messaging.
