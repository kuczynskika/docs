## How carrier registration works

Carrier registration is built into your phone number setup process with MessageDesk. When you configure your phone lines, registration happens automatically as part of the same workflow—you don't need to complete it as a separate first step.

## Starting the registration and phone setup process

You'll complete both carrier registration and phone configuration through our [phone setup form](https://messagedesk.typeform.com/to/bBBLwZXX).

You can access this form by:
- Clicking `Add Phone Number` from the Inbox side navigation
- Going to Settings → Phone Management

## What to expect in the form

The form uses smart routing to guide you through the right steps:

1. **Registration status check** - First, you'll indicate whether you've already completed carrier registration
   - **If yes:** You'll proceed directly to choosing your phone configuration
   - **If no:** You'll provide your business information, then choose your phone configuration

2. **Phone configuration options** - After registration (or if you've already registered), you'll select how to set up your numbers:
   - **Purchase new numbers:**
     - Local 10DLC
     - Toll-free
   - **Connect existing numbers:**
     - Local 10DLC
     - VoIP/Landline
     - Toll-free

<Note>
  **Twilio users:** If you're connecting Twilio numbers, you manage carrier registration through your Twilio account before connecting to MessageDesk. You won't need to complete registration through our form.
