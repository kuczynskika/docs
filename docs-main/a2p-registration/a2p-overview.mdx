# SMS Registration Basics

## What is carrier registration?

A2P 10DLC is how US carriers verify businesses that text from local 10‑digit numbers. Registration tells carriers who you are and what you send, so your messages get delivered and aren't filtered. It's required for business texting in the US.

If you text from toll‑free numbers, there's a separate toll‑free verification as well.

## Who needs to register?

- All businesses texting US numbers from MessageDesk local numbers.
- Sole proprietors without an EIN can register too (with limits).
- Toll‑free phone numbers require their own free verification per number.

## How long does registration take?

- Typical approval: 5–7 business days
- Sometimes longer if info can't be verified immediately
- You may have limited or paused sending to US numbers while you wait

## Your registration path

Pick one. If you're unsure, choose Business (EIN).

- **Business (EIN)**
  - Requirements: Legal business name, EIN, business address, website or public listing
