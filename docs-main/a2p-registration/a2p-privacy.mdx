## What carriers look for (checklist)

- **Exact business details** match what you submit in registration.
- **Working website link** matches your business name and address.
- **Clear opt-out language** appears in at least one sample message.
- **Realistic examples** that match your brand and use case.
- **Consent method** documented (form, verbal, written, keyword).

## Common mistakes that cause rejections

- **Missing opt‑out instructions.** Always include “Reply STOP to opt out.”
- **No visible privacy policy.** Not in footer, not on forms.
- **Vague use case.** Be specific about what you send and why.
- **Broken or mismatched website link.** Fix URLs and branding.
- **New EIN (\<30 days).** Wait, then resubmit.

## Sample messages (copy and adapt)

- “Hi [Name], your appointment is set for [Date] at [Time] with [Business]. Reply YES to confirm. Reply STOP to opt out.”
- “[Business]: Order [#1234] is ready for pickup at [Location]. Questions? Reply here. Reply STOP to opt out.”

## FAQs

- **Do I need a separate policy for SMS?**\
  No, but your existing privacy policy must clearly cover SMS data, consent, and opt‑out.
- **Do I need double opt‑in?**\
  Not required for all cases, but recommended for promotions to reduce risk.
- **Toll‑free numbers too?**\
  Yes—toll‑free has its own (free) verification. Still link your privacy policy on forms.

## Submit with confidence

- Publish or update your privacy policy.
- Link it in your footer and every opt‑in form.
- Include consent method and STOP language in your samples.
- Submit registration with exact business details.

This keeps your messages deliverable, compliant, and trusted by customers.
